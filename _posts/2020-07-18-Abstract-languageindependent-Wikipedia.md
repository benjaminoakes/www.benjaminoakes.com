> We know that the energy and the creativity of the community often runs up against language barriers, and information that is available in one language may not make it to other language Wikipedias. Abstract Wikipedia intends to look and feel like a Wikipedia, but build on the powerful, language-independent conceptual models of Wikidata, with the goal of letting volunteers create and maintain Wikipedia articles across our polyglot Wikimedia world.

The plan to make a language-independent representation of Wikipedia for translation into languages on the fly sounds an awful lot like a universal translator.  This would be very cool if they ever pull it off.
