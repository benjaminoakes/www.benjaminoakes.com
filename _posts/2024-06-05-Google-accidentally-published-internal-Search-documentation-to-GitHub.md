> Google apparently accidentally posted a big stash of internal technical
documents to GitHub, partially detailing how the search engine ranks
webpages. Google confirmed the authenticity of the documents to The Verge,
saying, "We would caution against making inaccurate assumptions about
Search based on out-of-context, outdated, or incomplete information. We've
shared extensive information about how Search works and the types of
factors that our systems weigh, while also working to protect the integrity
of our results from manipulation." The fun thing about accidentally
publishing to the GoogleAPI GitHub is that, while these are sensitive
internal documents, Google technically released them under an Apache 2.0
license.
