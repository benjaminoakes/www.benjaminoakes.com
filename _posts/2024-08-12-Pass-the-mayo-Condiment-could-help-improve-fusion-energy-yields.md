> Controlling a problematic instability could lead to cheaper internal
fusion.  "We use mayonnaise because it behaves like a solid, but when
subjected to a pressure gradient, it starts to flow," said Banerjee. "As
with a traditional molten metal, if you put a stress on mayonnaise, it will
start to deform, but if you remove the stress, it goes back to its original
shape. So there's an elastic phase followed by a stable plastic phase. The
next phase is when it starts flowing, and that's where the instability
kicks in."
