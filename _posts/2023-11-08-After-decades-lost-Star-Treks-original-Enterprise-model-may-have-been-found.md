> The first model of the USS Enterprise ever used in shooting the original
Star Trek series may have surfaced after going missing decades ago. An eBay
listing of a 3-foot model of the Enterprise appeared early last week and
named a starting bid of $1,000. Some of those enthusiasts said in the
private Facebook group "Star Trek Prop Makers & Collectors" that they had
contacted the seller suggesting it be returned to its rightful owners,
which many believe to be the estate of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry.
