>WeWork filed an IPO form in August 2019 but didn't go public until October 2021, when it merged with a special purpose acquisition company in a deal that valued it at about $9 billion. WeWork's market capitalization was about $120 million when the market closed yesterday and was down to about $60 million during trading today.
