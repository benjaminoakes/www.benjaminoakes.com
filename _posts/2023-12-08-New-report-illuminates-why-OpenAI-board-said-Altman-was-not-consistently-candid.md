> Reader comments 135 When Sam Altman was suddenly removed as CEO of
OpenAI-before being reinstated days later-the company's board publicly
justified the move by saying Altman "Was not consistently candid in his
communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its
responsibilities." In the days since, there has been some reporting on
potential reasons for the attempted board coup, but not much in the way of
follow-up on what specific information Altman was allegedly less than
"Candid" about. Now, in an in-depth piece for The New Yorker, writer
Charles Duhigg-who was embedded inside OpenAI for months on a separate
story-suggests that some board members found Altman "Manipulative and
conniving" and took particular issue with the way Altman allegedly tried to
manipulate the board into firing fellow board member Helen Toner. Though
Toner reportedly apologized to the board for the paper, Duhigg writes that
Altman nonetheless started to approach individual board members urging her
removal.
