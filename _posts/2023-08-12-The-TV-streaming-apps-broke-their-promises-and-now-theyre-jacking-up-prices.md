> This week, Disney+ and the Disney-controlled Hulu became the latest
streaming video services to increase prices. That's just capturing price
increases from the last year or so; many of these services have increased
prices steadily over the last two or three years, as subscriber growth has
slowed or declined. If you pay for more than a couple of these services,
your prices have either gone up a lot in the last year, or you've decided
to let TV advertising back into your life.

And now DVDs aren't a great second option either.  Huh.
