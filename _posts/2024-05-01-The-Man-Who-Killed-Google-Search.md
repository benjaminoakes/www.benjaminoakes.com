> The thread is a dark window into the world of growth-focused tech, where
Thakur listed the multiple points of disconnection between the ads and
search teams, discussing how the search team wasn't able to finely optimize
engagement on Google without "Hacking engagement," a term that means
effectively tricking users into spending more time on a site, and that
doing so would lead them to "Abandon work on efficient journeys." In one
email, Fox adds that there was a "Pretty big disconnect between what
finance and ads want" and what search was doing. The man who deposed Ben
Gomes - someone who worked on Google Search from the very beginning - was
so shit at his job that in 2009 Yahoo effectively threw in the towel on its
own search technology, instead choosing to license Bing's engine in a
ten-year deal. Since Prabhakar took the reins in 2020, Google Search has
dramatically declined, with the numerous "Core" search updates allegedly
made to improve the quality of results having an adverse effect, increasing
the prevalence of spammy, search engine optimized content.
