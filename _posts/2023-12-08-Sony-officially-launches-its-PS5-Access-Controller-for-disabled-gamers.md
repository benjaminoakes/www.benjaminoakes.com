> The controller, which was created in collaboration with disabled gaming
groups such as AbleGamers, Stack-Up, and SpecialEffect, has a unique
circular design. The controller comes with a number of different button
caps, along with three stick caps that can be changed out to suit the
specific needs of the gamer. The controller itself is also designed to rest
on a flat surface for players that would require that kind of feature.

I hope there's an equivalent for Nintendo.
