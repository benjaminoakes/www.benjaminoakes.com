> Users were left with no RSS reader application, no comparable
alternative, and no education from Google on how to continue using their
RSS feeds without Google Reader. Google provided a Google Chrome extension
that places a small RSS icon next to a website's URL in the browser bar if
you're on a web page that has an RSS feed. After many RSS users were locked
in and relying on the Google News app for their RSS feeds, Google
deprecated RSS support, causing users' RSS feeds to stop working.

I knew more people on Google Reader than Google Plus.  I have to imagine
they could still make it work, but perhaps there's something I simply don't
understand.

I'm just waiting for DHH to make a news reader.
