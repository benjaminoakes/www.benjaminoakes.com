> Google Podcasts (2016-2024) is Google's third attempt at a podcasting app
after the Google Reader-powered Google Listen (2009-2012) and Google Play
Music Podcasts (2016-2020). The product is being shut down in favor of
podcast app No. 4, YouTube Podcasts, which launched in 2022.
>
> Google support article details how you can take your subscriptions with
you. If you want to move from Google Podcasts to YouTube Podcasts, Google
makes that pretty easy with a one-click button at
music.youtube.com/transfer_podcasts. If you want to leave the Google
ecosystem for something with less of a chance of being shut down in three
to four years, you can also export your Google Podcast subscriptions as an
OPML file at podcasts.google.com/settings. Google says exports will be
available until August 2024.
