> In response to a new Canadian law requiring payments to news
organizations, Google said it will remove links to Canadian news sources
from Google Search and Google News for users who access the services in
Canada. "We have now informed the Government that when the law takes
effect, we unfortunately will have to remove links to Canadian news from
our Search, News and Discover products in Canada, and that [bill] C-18 will
also make it untenable for us to continue offering our Google News Showcase
product in Canada," Google President of Global Affairs Kent Walker wrote
yesterday. Google complained that Canada's Online News Act "Requir[es] two
companies to pay for simply showing links to news, something that everyone
else does for free. The unprecedented decision to put a price on links
creates uncertainty for our products and exposes us to uncapped financial
liability simply for facilitating Canadians' access to news from Canadian
publishers. We have been saying for over a year that this is the wrong
approach to supporting journalism in Canada and may result in significant
changes to our products."

Okay, but what's a reasonable compromise?
