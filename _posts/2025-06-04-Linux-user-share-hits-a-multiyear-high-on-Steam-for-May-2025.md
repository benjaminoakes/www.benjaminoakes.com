>The Linux user share on Steam has been slowly but steadily trending upwards, with May 2025 showing the highest point in years. At least since 2018, this is the highest it has ever been in a long time. When you take into account how Steam is always growing, it's showing that the amount of Linux users on Steam continues to grow nicely too.
