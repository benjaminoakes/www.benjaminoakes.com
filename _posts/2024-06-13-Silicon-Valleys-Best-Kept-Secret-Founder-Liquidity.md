> Founder liquidity refers to the practice where founders sell a portion of
their shares during a new funding round. Why is it a secret that founders
get liquidity in many venture rounds? Because it undermines the narrative
of the founder who is "All-in." The story of the founder who mortgaged
their house and lived on ramen noodles for years is compelling. Investors
and founders both tend to think that if employees knew founders were
getting liquidity that that would negatively impact employee morale
Founders often feel guilty that they are getting liquidity Investors think
that the liquidity could taint the perception of future investors
negatively Investors, founders, and employees all believe that founders are
taking more risk than early employees.
