> Tesla has revived a contract clause that says the electric carmaker could
sue Cybertruck buyers for $50,000 or more if they resell during their first
year of ownership. The clause says Cybertruck buyers must offer the car
back to Tesla at a reduced price before any attempt to resell the vehicle
within one year of delivery. If Tesla declines to buy the Cybertruck back,
the owner could resell it only if Tesla provides "Written consent."
