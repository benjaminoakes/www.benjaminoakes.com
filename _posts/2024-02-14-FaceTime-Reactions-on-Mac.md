>If you're using a Mac with Apple silicon running macOS Sonoma, the FaceTime effects work just the same, and fill your video frame with a 3D effect expressing how you feel. [...] To disable reactions on your Mac, simply click the Reactions button in the FaceTime menu bar dropdown so that it is no longer illuminated.

I didn't know this existed until today.  I'm surprised this is enabled by default.

> But since this feature is on by default, it has resulted in some awkward moments during serious work meetings or other video sessions that do not require celebration effects, for example.

I mean... It's fun, but not always appropriate.

Good thing I'm still on macOS Ventura?
