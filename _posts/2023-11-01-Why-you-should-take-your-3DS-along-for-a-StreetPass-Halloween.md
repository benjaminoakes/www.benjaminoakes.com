> Even as most portable gamers have given up their 3DS consoles for the
Switch or Steam Deck, thousands of 3DS fans have met at various events this
year to trade StreetPass "Tags" with their nostalgic brethren. Kressley
said his love for the 3DS dates back to middle school, when "Just walking
around the hallways could give me a few StreetPass tags" each day. Since
the launch of the Switch in 2017 Kressley said the online community of 3DS
fans was finding it harder and harder to get that "Special feeling" of
finding a series of random StreetPass tags while wandering around in public.
