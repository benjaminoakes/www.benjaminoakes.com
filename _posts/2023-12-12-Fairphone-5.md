> This repairability overview makes me happy!! I'm overall very pleased
with my Fairphone 5. Because I'm a cameraman as a profession, I'm very
picky about the camera in the Fairphone 5. Since I know I'll be able to
replace my screen easily if needed, I'm comfortable with this device! So
yes, I really do recommend the Fairphone 5 with 5 stars!!

Still no headphone jack, though that's a common request. One of the better
options for a sustainable smartphone.  Or really, a phone in general, these
days.
