> With "Adaptive audio," you and your team can join Google Meet using
multiple laptops in close proximity without awkward echos and audio
feedback. Adaptive audio in Meet will automatically detect the presence of
multiple laptops in the room and synchronize the microphones and speakers
for a seamless audio experience. Most importantly, adaptive audio gives
users the flexibility to join meetings when meeting rooms are not
available, meeting room hardware is not working, or for smaller
organizations, when there isn't dedicated video conferencing equipment in
every room.
