title: "GM justifies decision to ditch Apple CarPlay due to stability issues"

> Built on the Android Automotive OS-not to be confused with the Android
Auto phone casting system-a build we used in a model year 2023 Cadillac
Lyriq featured the most complete implementation of CarPlay we've yet
experienced, making GM's decision to ditch the systems even more
frustrating. Motor Trend wrote, "CarPlay and Android Auto have stability
issues that manifest as bad connections, poor rendering, slow responses,
and dropped connections. And when CarPlay and Android Auto have issues,
drivers pick up their phones again, taking their eyes off the road and
totally defeating the purpose of these phone-mirroring programs. Solving
those issues can sometimes be beyond the control of the automaker. You can
start to see GM's frustration." GM wrote to the publication to say that
"Comments about GM's position on phone projection were misrepresented in
previous articles and to reinforce our valued partnerships with Apple and
Google and each company's commitment to driver safety. GM's embedded
infotainment strategy is driven by the benefits of having a system that
allows for greater integration with the larger GM ecosystem and vehicles."

It needs to be a dedicated device that you can just plug into the car.
This seems like something that should be possible to sell for $50.
