> New research reveals that chatbots like ChatGPT can infer a lot of
sensitive information about the people they chat with, even if the
conversation is utterly mundane. Vechev and his team found that the large
language models that power advanced chatbots can accurately infer an
alarming amount of personal information about users-including their race,
location, occupation, and more-from conversations that appear innocuous.
OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says the company makes efforts to remove
personal information from training data used to create its models and fine
tunes them to reject requests for personal data.
