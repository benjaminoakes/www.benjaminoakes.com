> At first glance, when it comes to the energy used to get more energy-the
energy return on investment-fossil fuels seem like a clear winner. A new
study by researchers at the UK's University of Leeds suggests that this
isn't a concern at all-in most countries, renewables already produce more
net energy than the fossil fuels they're displacing. Using the 2020 data,
the final, delivered-to-end-user EROI of fossil fuels is quite good, at
approximately 8.5, meaning you get about 8.5 units of energy out for every
one you invest.
