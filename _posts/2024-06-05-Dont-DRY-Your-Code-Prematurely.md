> Many of us have been told the virtues of "Don't Repeat Yourself" or DRY.
Pause and consider: Is the duplication truly redundant or will the
functionality need to evolve independently over time? Applying DRY
principles too rigidly leads to premature abstractions that make future
changes more complex than necessary. Think about how the functions' purpose
holds with time, not just about making the code shorter.
