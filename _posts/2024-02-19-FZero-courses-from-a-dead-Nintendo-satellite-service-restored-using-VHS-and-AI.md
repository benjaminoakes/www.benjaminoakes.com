> Nintendo's Satellaview, a Japan-only satellite add-on for the Super
Famicom, is a rich target for preservationists because it was the home to
some of the most ephemeral games ever released. Remarkably, the 10 courses
in those later broadcasts were reverse-engineered, using a VHS recording,
machine learning tools, and some manual pixel-by-pixel re-creation. Using
Graphite as inspiration and having the data from the original Grand Prix
broadcast as a baseline, an F-Zero superfan going by Guy Perfect built a
tool that could reproduce the controller input from a miraculous VHS copy
of the missing second Grand Prix.

Does Nintendo still have copies? Seems like something people might pay for
