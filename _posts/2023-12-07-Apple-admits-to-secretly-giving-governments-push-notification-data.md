> Data transmitted to Google and Apple includes metadata "Detailing which
app received a notification and when, as well as the phone and associated
Apple or Google account to which that notification was intended to be
delivered," Wyden wrote. "As with all of the other information these
companies store for or about their users, because Apple and Google deliver
push notification data, they can be secretly compelled by governments to
hand over this information," Wyden wrote. A Google spokesperson told Ars
that Google was "The first major company to publish a public transparency
report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we
receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden." That means
Google's transparency report, Ars confirmed, already documents requests for
push notification data in aggregated data of all government requests for
user information.
