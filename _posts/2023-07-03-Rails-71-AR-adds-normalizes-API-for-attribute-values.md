>Sometimes you may want to standardize the data before saving it to the database. For example, downcasing emails, removing any leading and trailing whitespaces, and so on. Rails 7.1 adds `ActiveRecord::Base::normalizes` API, which allows you to normalize attribute values to a common format before saving them to the database. This can help improve the integrity and consistency of your data and make it simpler to query records based on attribute values.

A nice idea!
