> Funimation, a Sony-owned streaming service for anime, recently announced
that subscribers' digital libraries on the platform will be unavailable
after April 2. In addition to offering video streaming, Funimation also
dubbed and released anime as physical media, and sometimes those DVDs or
Blu-rays would feature a digital code. Subscribers to the Funimation
streaming service could add those digital codes to Funimation and then
stream the content from the platform.
