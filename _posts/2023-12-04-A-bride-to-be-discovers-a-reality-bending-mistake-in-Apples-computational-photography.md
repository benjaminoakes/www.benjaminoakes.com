> The photo shows Coates in a dress in front of two mirrors, but each of
the three versions of her had a different pose. One mirror showed her with
her arms down, the other mirror showed her hands joined at her waist, and
her real self was standing with her left arm at her side. The camera
wouldn't realize it was taking a photo of a mirror, so it treated the three
versions of Coates as different people.

Can we trust our cameras?
