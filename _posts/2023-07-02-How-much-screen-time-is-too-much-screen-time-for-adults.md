> Many of us know excessive screen time isn't the best for our health, but
with more and more of our work and personal lives moving to the digital
space, drastically cutting back on screen time isn't always feasible.

in young adults as well as sedentary behavior that can lead to weight gain,
increased risk of depression and increased stress and loneliness. Roy
recommends limiting your overall screen time to eight hours per day if you
use a screen for work or two to four hours per day for recreational use.

Easy to say but hard to do for anyone that works remotely. Everything is
screen time.
