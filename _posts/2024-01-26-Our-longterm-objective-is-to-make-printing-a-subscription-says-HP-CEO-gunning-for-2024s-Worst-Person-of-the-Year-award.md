> Now the company's CEO, Enrique Lores, says HP wants to "Make printing a subscription." Nice. Needless to say, forcing printer users over to a subscription model would likely require that the machines rejected third party cartridges to make any sense. Any court decision pertaining to existing printers, which are purchased by consumers, probably won't apply to printers that may be supplied for free alongside a subscription contract for the ink, perhaps similar to those associated with mobile phones and network charges.
