> Amazon will no longer pursue a $1.4 billion acquisition of iRobot, maker
of Roomba robot vacuums after the companies announced today that they have
"No path to regulatory approval in the European Union." As part of the
deal's terms, Amazon will pay $94 million to iRobot, most of it earmarked
for paying back a three-year, $200 million loan the company took out when
the Amazon acquisition was announced in August 2022. EC officials were also
concerned about Amazon using labels like "Works with Alexa" or "Amazon's
Choice" with iRobot products.
