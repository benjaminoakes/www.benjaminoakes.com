title: "Lawsuit against Prime Video ads shows perils of annual streaming subscriptions"

> Streaming services like Amazon Prime Video promote annual subscriptions
as a way to save money. The lawsuit recently filed against Prime Video
names California resident Wilbert Napoleon as a plaintiff and argues that
Amazon's advertisements for Prime Video made "Reasonable consumers" think
that they would get ad-free movie and TV-show streaming for the duration of
their subscription. Amazon reportedly had plans to bring ads to the service
as early as June, per a report from The Wall Street Journal that cited
anonymous "People familiar with the situation." Despite these reported
plans to alter the user experience significantly, Amazon continued to sell
annual subscriptions to Prime Video.
