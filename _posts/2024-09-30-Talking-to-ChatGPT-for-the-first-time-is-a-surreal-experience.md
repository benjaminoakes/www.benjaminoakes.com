>Even in this short introductory "chat," we were impressed by the natural, dare we say, human cadence and delivery of ChatGPT's "savvy and relaxed" Sol voice (which reminds us a bit of '90s Janeane Garofalo). Between ChatGPT's ability to give quick responses--offered in milliseconds rather than seconds--and convincing intonation, it's incredibly easy to fool yourself into thinking you're speaking to a conscious being rather than what is, as ChatGPT says here, "still just a computer program processing information, without real emotions or consciousness."

Great and not great at the same time.  This could decimate entire industries.
