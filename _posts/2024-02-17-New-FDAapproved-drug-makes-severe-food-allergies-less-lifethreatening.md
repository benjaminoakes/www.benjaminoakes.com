> On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the antibody drug
omalizumab as an injection to lessen allergic reactions to foods in people
ages 1 and up. "While it will not eliminate food allergies or allow
patients to consume food allergens freely, its repeated use will help
reduce the health impact if accidental exposure occurs." The FDA notes that
17 percent of the people who received the drug had no significant
improvement in their sensitivity to allergy-triggering food.
