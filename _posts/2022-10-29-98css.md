> This library relies on the usage of semantic HTML. To make a button, you'll need to use a <button>. Input elements require labels. Icon buttons rely on aria-label. This page will guide you through that process, but accessibility is a primary goal of this project. [...] This library does not contain any JavaScript, it merely styles your HTML with some CSS. This means 98.css is compatible with your frontend framework of choice.

Silly and fun.  Love the semantic, no-JS approach.
