> The long-in-development work for a fully-functional multi-threaded FFmpeg
command line has been merged! The FFmpeg CLI with multi-threaded
transcoding pipelines is now merged to FFmpeg Git ahead of FFmpeg 7.0
releasing early next year. FFmpeg is widely-used throughout many industries
for video transcoding and in today's many-core world this is a terrific
improvement for this key open-source project. In recently sharing a
technical presentation on the FFmpeg multi-threading effort, FFmpeg
developers called this work "One of the most complex refactoring of the
FFmpeg CLI in decades." And in calling for testing today added, "Please
test and report issues to - this is one of the most complex changes in
FFmpeg ever!".
