>In a somewhat anticipated move, Belkin is killing most of its smart home products. On January 31, the company will stop supporting the majority of its Wemo devices, leaving users without core functionality and future updates.

From what I can tell:

Wemo smart plugs will stop working in Google Home and the official Wemo app on January 31st, 2026. The company that makes it (Belkin) doesn't want to support it anymore, probably because they want people to buy new ones.

The good news is that it should (?) keep working in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) indefinitely. In fact, that would seem to be the only way older Wemo devices will work anymore. This is because it can work only over Wi-Fi, but I guess they don't do that for the official way of making it work.  It's not clear if you can still set up Wi-Fi on newly obtained devices.

Thank goodness for the people who made Home Assistant.
