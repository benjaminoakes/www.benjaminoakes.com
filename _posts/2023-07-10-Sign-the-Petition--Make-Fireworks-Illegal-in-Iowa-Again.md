title: "Sign the Petition - Make Fireworks Illegal in Iowa Again"
date: 2023-07-10

> This letter is to request the retail sale and private use of fireworks be
once again made illegal statewide in Iowa. "Iowa halted the sale of most
retail fireworks on Jan. 1, 1938, in the wake of two devastating
fireworks-related blazes in northwest Iowa. In Spencer, nearly five blocks
of the city's main business district were destroyed in a 1931 fire after a
boy dropped a lit sparkler in a drugstore fireworks display. Twenty-five
buildings were lost, and 50 more were damaged. In Remsen, a girl dropped a
sparkler on a pile of gasoline-soaked rags in a garage on July 4, 1936,
destroying 20 businesses and leaving 100 people homeless." Please, change
the law and make the retail sale and private use of fireworks illegal again
in the State of Iowa..

It's only a matter of time before something notably bad happens. Not to be
forgotten: the noise and pollution, of course.  Please sign this.
