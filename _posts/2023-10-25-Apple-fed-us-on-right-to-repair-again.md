> Apple f***ed us on right to repair: "Parts-pairing" is a scam. Right to
repair has no cannier, more dedicated adversary than Apple, a company whose
most innovative work is dreaming up new ways to sneakily sabotage
electronics repair while claiming to be a caring environmental steward, a
lie that covers up the mountains of e-waste that Apple dooms our
descendants to wade through. Parts-pairing lets Apple block repairs even
when the technician uses new, Apple parts - but it also lets Apple block
refurb parts and third party parts.

This is something I'm sure right to repair laws (and lobbyists) will take
into account.
