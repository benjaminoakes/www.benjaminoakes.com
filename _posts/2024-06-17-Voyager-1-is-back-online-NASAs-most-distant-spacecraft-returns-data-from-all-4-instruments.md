> NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft is fully operational once more, with all four
science instruments returning usable data to Earth. After the team
relocated the code to a new location in the FDS, Voyager 1 finally sent
back intelligible data on April 20, 2024 - but only from two of its four
science instruments. Now that Voyager 1 is back online, the team will
continue to "Touch up" the spacecraft to get it back in top form, including
resynchronizing its timekeeping software to execute commands at the right
time, as well as performing maintenance on the digital tape recorder that
measures plasma waves.
