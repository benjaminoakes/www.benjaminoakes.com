> We've seen or been part of many discussions - strategic discussions at
work, discussions on AI alignment, technical design documents, public
policy, etc. The default way of discussions - in-person ones - are highly
susceptible to impulsive responses and are extremely hard to provide a good
structure for, making them the worst for complex topics. That's why we
prefer written, async discussions over in-person ones for complex topics -
they help prevent impulsive responses to an extent and promote thoughtful
responses.
