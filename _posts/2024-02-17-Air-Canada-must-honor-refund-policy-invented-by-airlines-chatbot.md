title: "Air Canada must honor refund policy invented by airline's chatbot"

> After months of resisting, Air Canada was forced to give a partial refund
to a grieving passenger who was misled by an airline chatbot inaccurately
explaining the airline's bereavement travel policy. According to Air
Canada, Moffatt never should have trusted the chatbot and the airline
should not be liable for the chatbot's misleading information because Air
Canada essentially argued that "The chatbot is a separate legal entity that
is responsible for its own actions," a court order said. When Ars visited
Air Canada's website on Friday, there appeared to be no chatbot support
available, suggesting that Air Canada has disabled the chatbot.
