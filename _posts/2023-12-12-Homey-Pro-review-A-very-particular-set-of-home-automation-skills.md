> Homey Pro is a smart home hub pitched primarily at someone who wants to
keep things local as much as possible, forgoing phone apps, speakers, and
cloud connections. The Smart Home Scene blog did a teardown and chip ID on
the Homey Pro for those working at that level of smart home engagement.
Homey Pro is very good at adding Zigbee and Z-Wave devices, at least
frequency-wise; I had no trouble getting the Homey Pro to see, "Interview,"
and configure a few test devices that Homey provided, along with other gear
I had handy.

The more I use it, the more Google Home seems... Questionable. I'm not
super interested in replacing parts that break at this point. Perhaps a
non-cloud solution would be better.
