> In this article, I expose the new version of the streaming tool for my
reMarkable tablet. Originally crafted in 2021, this tool allowed me to
stream sketches during video calls. Aiming for more user-friendliness, I
revamped the design to a clientless implementation. This articles describes
the implementation with some code illustrations in Javascript and Go on how
to  get the picture and to display it in a canvas optimize the flow by
playing with uint4 and RLE

The reMarkable is an interesting device, but I have to wonder why they have
an iPad and a reMarkable...

Also, past a point, wouldn't some sheets of paper and an overhead camera
achieve the same thing?  Don't get me wrong, this is interesting, but I'm
on the fence about the value.
