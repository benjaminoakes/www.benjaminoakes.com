>I was laid off last Friday by SmartBear, who in June 2019 acquired the company I co-founded back in August 2013. It's no secret that I had recently been involved in a research project to determine Cucumber's future direction at SmartBear. As the last remaining employee lucky enough to be paid to work on the open source project full-time, I guess the powers that be had already made their minds up about what the outcome of that research would be.

I've never been a huge fan of Cucumber or RelishApp, but I have certainly found myself reading content hosted there quite a bit.  Isn't it open source?  I'm wondering if someone can step up and resurrect it.
