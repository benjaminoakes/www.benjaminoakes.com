> This is a wee operating system written to support the async style of
programming in Rust on microcontrollers. It fits in about 2 kiB of Flash
and uses about 20 bytes of RAM (before your tasks are added). In that
space, you get a full async runtime with multiple tasks, support for
complex concurrency via join and select, and a lot of convenient but simple
APIs. (If you want to see what a lilos program looks like, look in the
examples directory, or read the intro guide.)

Interesting!  Very, very tiny.
