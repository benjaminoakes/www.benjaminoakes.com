> ruby 2.5.0 introduces branch coverage! Thats a great news because in the future, tools like [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) will be able to report us exactly which branches of our code have been executed and which have not been.

> Code coverage is mainly used in test suites, to report how much of the application code has been covered by tests. This means more precise numbers in the future and the assurance that all the branches of your code have been covered. Thats great!
