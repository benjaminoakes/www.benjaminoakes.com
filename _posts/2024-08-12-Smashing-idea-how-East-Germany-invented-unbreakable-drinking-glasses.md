title: "Smashing idea: how East Germany invented 'unbreakable' drinking glasses"
date: 2024-08-12

> Invented in the industry-rich but resource-poor socialist German
Democratic Republic, Superfest glasses were designed with the aim of making
them last five times longer than ordinary drinking glasses. Glass retailers
depend on their products breaking - this new idea was a threat to profits.
The problem with the original Superfest glass is that its manufacturers
worked with modified alumino or borosilicate glass, which is not as easy to
recycle as the more common soda-lime glass.
