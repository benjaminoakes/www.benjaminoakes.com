> AntennaPod has been around for a long time -- the first bit of code was
published in 2011. Since then, the app has grown massively and had several
main developers. The beauty of open-source is that so many people can
contribute and make a great app together. But sometimes having many people
work on a project can lead to different ways of thinking about how to
structure the project. Because of this, AntennaPod gradually grew to have a
number of weird code constructs. Our latest release, version 3.4, fixes
this.
