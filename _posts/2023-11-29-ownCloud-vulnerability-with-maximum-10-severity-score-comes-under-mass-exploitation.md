title: "ownCloud vulnerability with maximum 10 severity score comes under \"mass\" exploitation"

> The vulnerability, which carries the maximum severity rating of 10, makes
it possible to obtain passwords and cryptographic keys allowing
administrative control of a vulnerable server by sending a simple Web
request to a static URL, ownCloud officials warned last week. Within four
days of the November 21 disclosure, researchers at security firm Greynoise
said, they began observing "Mass exploitation" in their honeypot servers,
which masqueraded as vulnerable ownCloud servers to track attempts to
exploit the vulnerability. OwnCloud officials didn't immediately respond to
an email seeking technical details of the vulnerability and the precise
conditions required for it to be exploited.

I like the idea of ownCloud, but in practice, it leaves a quite a bit to be
desired.
