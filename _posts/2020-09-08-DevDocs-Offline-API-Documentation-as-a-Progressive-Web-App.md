This is really well done.  Reminds me of a concept I had before called [Airplane Mode](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/airplane_mode) (archived).

I installed this today after realizing it's the first day of (basically) online-only school where I live and that that might cause problems.  At least I can look up documentation offline now.  :)
