title: "Hackers stole ancestry data of 6.9 million users, 23andMe finally confirmed"

> It has now been confirmed that an additional 6.9 million 23andMe users
had ancestry data stolen after hackers accessed thousands of accounts by
likely reusing previously leaked passwords. After the cyberattack was
reported, Wired estimated that "At least a million data points from 23andMe
accounts" that were "Exclusively about Ashkenazi Jews" and data points from
"Hundreds of thousands of users of Chinese descent" seemed to be exposed.
When the hack was first reported, a nonprofit dedicated to defending online
privacy, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, reported that "There are no
federal laws that clearly protect users of online genetic testing sites
like 23andMe." While 23andMe recommended that all users strengthen their
passwords, EFF went one step further and suggested that users consider
disabling the DNA Relatives feature, especially if they're not actively
using it.

It's sad that the result is predictable.
