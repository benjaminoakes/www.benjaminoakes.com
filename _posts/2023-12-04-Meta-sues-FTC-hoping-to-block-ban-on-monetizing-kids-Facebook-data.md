> The FTC proposed changes to the 2020 privacy order that would, among
other things, prohibit Facebook from monetizing data it collects from users
under 18. Meta's lawsuit against the FTC challenges what it calls "The
structurally unconstitutional authority exercised by the FTC through its
Commissioners in an administrative reopening proceeding against Meta." It
was filed against the FTC, Chair Lina Khan, and other commissioners in US
District Court for the District of Columbia. Meta says it should have a
right to a trial by jury and that "Congress unconstitutionally has
delegated to the FTC the power to assign disputes to administrative
adjudication rather than litigating them before an Article III court." The
FTC should not be allowed to "Unilaterally modify the terms" of the 2020
settlement, Meta said.
