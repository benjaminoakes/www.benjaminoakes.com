>Now this, this is something I've wanted for a very long time. Shorthand Hash Syntax, also known as Punning in Javascript, is an incredibly useful feature that allows you to omit values where the variable name is the same as the key:

```ruby
a = 1
b = 2

{ a:, b: }
# => { a: 1, b: 2 }
```

Sounds like it could be handy.
