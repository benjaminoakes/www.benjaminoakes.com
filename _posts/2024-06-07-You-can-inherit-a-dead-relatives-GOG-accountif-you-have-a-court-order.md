> "In general, your GOG account and GOG content is not transferable," GOG
spokesperson Zuzanna Rybacka tells Ars. "However, if you can obtain a copy
of a court order that specifically entitles someone to your GOG personal
account, the digital content attached to it, taking into account the EULAs
of specific games within it, and that specifically refers to your GOG
username or at least email address used to create such an account, we'd do
our best to make it happen." While convincing a judge that your dead
relative wanted you to have access to their GOG library might not always be
the simplest process, a court order at least provides a viable path to
getting such an account out of the legal limbo that usually enshrouds your
digital goods after death.
