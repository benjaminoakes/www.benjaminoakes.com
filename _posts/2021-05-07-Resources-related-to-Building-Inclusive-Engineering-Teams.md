Related to my earlier post, [Building Inclusive Engineering Teams](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/inclusivity/2020/08/25/Building-Inclusive-Engineering-Teams/), these are some resources I recently became aware of:

> The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

> To be an antiracist, thus means that we all have an obligation to understand how language shapes racist beliefs. While I already knew that some of the terms listed herein are inherently racist, such as "the pot calling the kettle black" and "cotton picking," there are others whose origins are new to me such as "low hanging fruit" and "urban."
