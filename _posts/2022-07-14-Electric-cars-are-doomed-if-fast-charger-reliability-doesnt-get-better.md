>Even the biggest EV enthusiasts can't ignore the fact that it takes a lot longer to recharge a battery than fill a tank with liquid hydrocarbons--even when that battery is connected to a very high-voltage DC fast charger. For about two-thirds of American car buyers--those who have somewhere at home to charge overnight--this isn't a problem most of the time. On average, people only drive 29 miles a day, so even short-range EVs should actually meet the needs of most drivers.

PHEVs are a good stepping stone. I really hope BEVs and charging come together by the time we need a new car.
