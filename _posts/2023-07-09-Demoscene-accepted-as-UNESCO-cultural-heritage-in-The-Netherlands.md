> Today the demoscene was accepted as Dutch national intangible cultural
heritage. We very happy about the success of the Dutch demoscene to be
accepted as a living national cultural heritage! The Dutch inscription is
continuing the success story of the demoscene as first digital culture
accepted by the UNESCO. Previously the demoscene became cultural heritage

This is cool, but every time I see the name demoscene, it makes me feel
like it's an era like Jurassic or Paleolithic.
