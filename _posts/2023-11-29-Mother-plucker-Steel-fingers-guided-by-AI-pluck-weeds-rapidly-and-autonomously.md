> So a Swedish company named Ekobot AB has introduced a wheeled robot that
can autonomously recognize and pluck weeds from the ground rapidly using
metal fingers. To pinpoint plants it needs to pluck, the Ekobot uses an
AI-powered machine vision system trained to identify weeds as it rolls
above the farm field. Once the weeds are within its sights, the robot uses
a series of metal fingers to quickly dig up and push weeds out of the dirt.

I hope they have a consumer version someday.
