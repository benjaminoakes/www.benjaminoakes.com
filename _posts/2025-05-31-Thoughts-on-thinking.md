>I have been stuck. Every time I sit down to write a blog post, code a feature, or start a project, I come to the same realization: in the context of AI, what I'm doing is a waste of time. It's horrifying. The fun has been sucked out of the process of creation because nothing I make organically can compete with what AI already produces--or soon will. All of my original thoughts feel like early drafts of better, more complete thoughts that simply haven't yet formed inside an LLM.
