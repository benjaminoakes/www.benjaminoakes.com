> TOKYO - A Japanese research team is making progress on the development of
a groundbreaking medication that may allow people to grow new teeth, with
clinical trials set to begin in July 2024. The tooth regrowth medicine is
intended for people who lack a full set of adult teeth due to congenital
factors. In prior animal experiments, the medicine prompted the growth of
"Third-generation" teeth following baby teeth and then permanent adult
teeth.
