Hard to tell, but it looks like we'll maybe be getting one in the Iowa City area... Or Davenport? Probably Des Moines too, I'd guess. I'm also looking forward to more EV charging in Omaha given how little currently exists there.

For anyone unfamiliar with EV charging, the big news here is mostly about a national Level 3 charging network. Tesla built their own, but this one will be usable by anyone. Plug-in hybrids like the Chevy Volt or Prius Prime can only charge at Level 1 or 2, so this is more important for all-electric cars like the Chevy Bolt EV which _can't_ stop at a gas station. (In the future, it should be possible to move off gas entirely, as long as we stay on the same trajectory!)

That said, these will also include Level 2 chargers, so it's still great news for anyone who drives a plug-in.
