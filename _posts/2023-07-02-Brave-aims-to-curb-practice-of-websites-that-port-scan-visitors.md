title: "Brave aims to curb practice of websites that port scan visitors"

> The Brave browser will take action against websites that snoop on
visitors by scanning their open Internet ports or accessing other network
resources that can expose personal information. Starting in version 1.54,
Brave will automatically block website port scanning, a practice that a
surprisingly large number of sites were found engaging in a few years ago.
"As far as we can tell, Brave is the only browser that will block requests
to localhost resources from both secure and insecure public sites, while
still maintaining a compatibility path for sites that users trust" the
Brave post said.

I hope this becomes a common security feature.
