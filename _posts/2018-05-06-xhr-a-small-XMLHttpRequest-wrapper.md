> A small XMLHttpRequest wrapper. Designed for use with browserify, webpack etc.

As [jQuery becomes less and less relevant](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/), I've found myself wanting a simpler way to do XHR.  I haven't used `xhr` much, but it seems like the type of solution I'd want.  (Either that or [the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), which returns a `Promise`.)
