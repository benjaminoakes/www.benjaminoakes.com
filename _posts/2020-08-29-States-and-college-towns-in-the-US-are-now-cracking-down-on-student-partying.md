> With cases spiking in Iowa, particularly among young adults, Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Thursday that the state would shut down bars, breweries and nightclubs in six counties, including the two with the states largest concentrations of college students. In Story County,  where Iowa State University is located, more than 1,000 of the 2,129 total cases have been reported since the start of August. Similarly, Johnson County, home to the University of Iowa,  is now averaging more than 100 new cases per day, up from about 25 new cases per day in early August.

Not how I like to see Iowa City in the news.  It was a mistake to let students move back, and now we have one of the highest number of cases per capita.  What are we possibly gaining that's worth that?
