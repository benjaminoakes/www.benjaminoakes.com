> Why does walking feel so intuitive when we're in a city built before
cars, yet as soon as we return home, walking feels like an unpleasant chore
that immediately drives us into a car? The extreme of this principle is
obvious: Walking down a traditional main street is more pleasurable than
walking through an industrial park. Even where land uses are similar,
engagement of frontage can vary a lot: picture the difference between
walking past the front doors of houses in a traditional neighborhood, and
walking past privacy fences and back yards in cul-de-sac suburban
neighborhoods.
