> If the condensation funnel is our visual cue of a tornado and it
disappears, then to the human mind, the tornado itself has disappeared.
Videos from other angles I've seen seem to show the condensation funnel
picking back up a little after the viral video ends, meaning the tornado
was only briefly visually disrupted, not destroyed. The bigger point still
stands: Blowing up a tornado is not a practical alternative to
preparedness, structure hardening, shelter availability, and awareness on
severe weather days.
