> Learn ASL with Dr. Bill Vicars of ASLUniversity. Here he is teaching basic American Sign Language (ASL) to Jen (a beginner who only knows the ABCs).  For ASL lessons and a self-study program, see https://lifeprint.com/

I've been working through these videos as I learn (and re-learn) ASL [with my toddler](https://www.amazon.com/Sign-Your-Baby-Communicate-Infants/dp/0966836774).  Dr. Bill is a talented instructor and it's nice to see that he's shared so much content online.
