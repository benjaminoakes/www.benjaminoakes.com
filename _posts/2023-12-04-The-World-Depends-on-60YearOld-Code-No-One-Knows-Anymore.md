> IBM's approach is fairly straightforward: Rather than relying exclusively
on a limited pool of human programmers to solve the problem, it built a
generative AI-powered code assistant that helps convert all that dusty old
COBOL code to a more modern language, thereby saving coders countless hours
of reprogramming. The watsonx Code Assistant allows programmers to select
specific bits of COBOL code and translate them into Java instantly.
Updating and modernizing old code is just the tip of the iceberg when it
comes to what's possible with AI-augmented code creation, and IBM isn't the
only company racing to build a solution.

To assist? Yes. To do it on its own? Perhaps not.
