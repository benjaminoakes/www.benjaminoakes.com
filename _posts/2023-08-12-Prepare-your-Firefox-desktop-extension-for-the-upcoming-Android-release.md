> Firefox will become the only major Android browser to support an open
extension ecosystem. For the past few years Firefox for Android officially
supported a small subset of extensions while we focused our efforts on
strengthening core Firefox for Android functionality and understanding the
unique needs of mobile browser users. We anticipate considerable user
demand for more extensions on Firefox for Android, so why not start
optimizing your desktop extension for mobile-use right away?

Let's hope this brings some real competition to this space.
