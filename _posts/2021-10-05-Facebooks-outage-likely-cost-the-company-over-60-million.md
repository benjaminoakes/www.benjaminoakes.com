>Facebook's services were restored by approximately 7 pm ET yesterday. The company has explicitly pointed out that the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change and that there is no indication at this time that any user data was compromised. Regardless, the incident is a testament to the dominance of social media and messaging platforms on various aspects of our lives and commerce, making their availability no longer optional.

I barely noticed they were down. I purposefully avoid Facebook though, given how they're a catalyst for many terrible, hateful things in our modern world.  If Facebook never came back up after this incident, it would be bad for some people for a period of time, but still generally a good thing.
