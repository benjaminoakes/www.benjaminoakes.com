>Importantly, this update is being released for beta users--those are people who signed up to get the latest features first. In that instance, you can't be entirely surprised when parts of your software change overnight. If you're the type to get up in arms about unexpected updates, the beta channel is not for you. The problem, however, is that Google makes it very easy to join betas and very hard to leave them--the current version of the Play Store doesn't even include a list of all your beta app subscriptions. People may join the beta for a Google app and continue getting beta updates for years without realizing it until suddenly, one day, Gboard has rounded keys.

I suggest you try out [FUTO Keyboard](https://keyboard.futo.org/) on Android.  It's open source, private, and high-quality.

Some comments I and others left:

> If you find yourself looking for a keyboard that's like Gboard, but open source and private, consider FUTO Keyboard. I've tried a lot of OSS keyboards and this one is the most impressive of the bunch! I especially like the keyboard shortcuts for select all, copy, cut, and paste.

> I've been using HeliBoard, which is also an excellent and highly-customisable FOSS keyboard. It uses the google library for gesture typing, though; so if FUTO has worked out another way of handling gesture typing that's very exciting.

benjaminoakes

> They have! That's a big part of why I'm so impressed. It's not as accurate because they don't spy on swiping for training data, but they have a gamified version for that: https://swipe.futo.org/keyboard. Even in alpha, it's good enough for daily use. I'm using it to write this.

> FUTO also has a self-hosted Google Photos competitor too called Immich, which is also very impressive. Other projects too. I encourage you to check them out!

pseudobscura

> You're right - I'm trying it now myself, and the prediction is amazingly good! Thank you so much for a great suggestion. Why does anyone still use Gboard?

> I'm glad to see another FUTO user here! It takes some patience, but swipe typing is certainly useable. Certainly plenty of room for improvement too, of course. If you haven't thrown a donation their way, I'd encourage it! A good, private keyboard is a very important project.
