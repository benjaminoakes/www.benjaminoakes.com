> Twinetroid is based on Metroid: Zebesian Incursion, Volume 5 of the Famicom Adventure Game Book series published in Japan from 1986-1991. These are essentially Choose Your Own Adventure books based on Nintendo games. The original text was translated off and on over the course of several years before being converted to Twine in November 2018.
