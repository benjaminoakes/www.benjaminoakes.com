[Building Inclusive Engineering Teams by Mekka Okereke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYsI-6_csMY)

My notes follow.

About inclusivity:

- There's no one answer.
- Best to widely share ideas for increasing inclusivity.
- Goal that scales: "we want to make our team a place where hard working collaborative smart people from all backgrounds can succeed and thrive".
- It's contextual (e.g. Black in US, Polish in post-Brexit UK).
- What matters: behaviors that are punished and rewarded.
- Need to be aware of when you're on the powerful side of the scale.
- Focus on things that are correct (fair evaluations of a situation) and discard the rest.

Actionable:

- **Consider context during reviews.**  Women get more comments on their PRs.  Some women in OSS work under fake names to avoid this.  Just being aware decreases this tendency.  (Think: would I make the same comment if it were person X instead?)  Similar effect on speaking time and perception of quality of decisions.  (Watch for interrupting, etc.)
- **Make a culture of inclusivity.**  Act on the aberrant behavior with a nudge.  Don't worry about being PC all the time; the culture will help correct you ("not sure if that sounded like you wanted").  "Like kittens in a box."  When a kitten escapes, put it back in the box.
- **Share how interviews are done.**  Google does this.  Stanford has an entire course on it.  Sharing interview details helps with acceptance rate into Google.
- **Reduce the number of bullet points on your job posting.**  Men will apply if they qualify for 3 of N bullet points, but women will apply if they qualify for 85% of N.
