> The central role of browsers has long motivated us to build and improve
Firefox in order to offer people an independent choice. The right way to
win users is to build a better product, but shortcuts can be irresistible -
and there's a long history of companies leveraging their control of devices
and operating systems to tilt the playing field in favor of their own
browser. For example: making it harder for a user to download and use a
different browser, ignoring or resetting a user's default browser
preference, restricting capabilities to the first-party browser, or
requiring the use of the first-party browser engine for third-party
browsers.
