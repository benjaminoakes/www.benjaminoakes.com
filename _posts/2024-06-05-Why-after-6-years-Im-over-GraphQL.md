REST APIs, I found GraphQL a breath of fresh air. With GraphQL we cannot
assume that all requests are equally hard on the server. Any errors
encountered are captured by the framework, leading to the fun task of
reading stack traces in JSON GraphQL error responses.

GraphQL doesn't make sense as a default approach.  It makes sense
sometimes, but infrequently.
