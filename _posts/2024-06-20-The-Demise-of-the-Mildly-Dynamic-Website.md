> Eventually, the era of PHP websites passed and static site generators
became the new fad. Everything old is new again! First you had people who
made static websites discovering dynamic websites, and then you had people
who made dynamic websites discovering static websites. If you have a static
website and you want to make it dynamic and you don't use PHP, pretty much
all options available to you imply a massive increase in complexity that
must be paid up front before you can do anything at all. The CGI/PHP
deployment and execution model clearly excites people as demonstrated by
the popularity of AWS Lambda, yet we still see relatively little new
development in this space; the ability to dip in and out of code in web
pages to offer mildly dynamic functionality on the server side without
frameworks is empowering yet is largely offered by PHP alone.
