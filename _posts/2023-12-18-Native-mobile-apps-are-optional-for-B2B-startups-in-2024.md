> I continue to see new B2B software startups struggle with native mobile apps. I think we're finally seeing another route for these B2B software startups in Progressive Web Applications going into 2024. Basically it's the idea that instead of multiple, distinct native applications, you can package one web application that feels native across all platforms.

Really hoping this takes off.
