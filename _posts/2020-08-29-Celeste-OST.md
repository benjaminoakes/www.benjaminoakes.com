> The most recent indie title to receive 10 from IGN, Celeste is a true platformer from top to bottom. In our Celeste review, we said, "The greatest triumph of Celeste is that its best-in-class jumping and dashing is blended beautifully with an important and sincere story and an incredible soundtrack that make it a genuinely emotional game, even when your feet are planted firmly on the ground." If you're a fan of platformers, then Celeste is not an experience you'll want to miss out on.

I've never played this game, but it looks good and [this song in its soundtrack has grown on me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsYHpiH2xs&t=1635s).
