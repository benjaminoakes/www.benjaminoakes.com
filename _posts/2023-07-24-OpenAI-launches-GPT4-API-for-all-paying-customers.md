> On Thursday, OpenAI announced that all paying API customers now have
access to the GPT-4 API. It also introduced updates to chat-based models,
announced a shift from the Completions API to the Chat Completions API, and
outlined plans for deprecation of older models. In a move to distance
itself from older GPT-3-style models, OpenAI has also opted to begin
retiring "Completions API" models in favor of newer Chat Completions API
models. Since its March launch, OpenAI says that its Chat Completions API
models now account for 97 percent of OpenAI's API GPT usage.

I'm still cautiously optimistic about GPT.
