> Google has agreed to pay Canadian news businesses $100 million a year to
comply with the country's Online News Act, despite previously saying it
would remove Canadian news links from search rather than make the required
payments. In June, six months before the law's implementation, Google said
it would not pay the "Link tax" and instead would remove links to Canadian
news sources from Google Search and Google News for users who access the
services in Canada. "Unlike search engines, we do not proactively pull news
from the Internet to place in our users' feeds and we have long been clear
that the only way we can reasonably comply with the Online News Act is by
ending news availability for people in Canada," Meta told the CBC. Canadian
officials previously estimated that Facebook would have to pay $62 million
a year, but the deal with Google suggests that Meta could lower that amount
significantly.
