> After years of legislative process, the near-final text of the eIDAS
regulation has been agreed by trialogue negotiators representing EU's key
bodies and will be presented to the public and parliament for a rubber
stamp before the end of the year. These changes radically expand the
capability of EU governments to surveil their citizens by ensuring
cryptographic keys under government control can be used to intercept
encrypted web traffic across the EU. Any EU member state has the ability to
designate cryptographic keys for distribution in web browsers and browsers
are forbidden from revoking trust in these keys without government
permission. If you're a European citizen, you can write to the member of
the European Parliament responsible for the eIDAS file - Romana JERKOVI? -
and register your concern.
