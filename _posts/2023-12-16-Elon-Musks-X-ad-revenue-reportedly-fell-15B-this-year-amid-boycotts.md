title: "Elon Musk's X ad revenue reportedly fell $1.5B this year amid boycotts"

> Musk's continued inflammatory statements about advertisers and the
platform's recent decision to reinstate the X account of Sandy Hook
shooting-denier Alex Jones could keep advertisers off X. That, as Musk has
warned, risks causing serious long-term damage to X as a viable platform.
Although Twitter/X stopped publicly reporting financial data when Musk took
over Twitter in 2022, Musk has been transparent about advertiser revenue
being down by "Roughly 50 percent" throughout 2023. Generating more ad
revenue is crucial not just to meet X's financial goals in 2024 but also to
hit Musk's projection of 1 billion monthly X users in 2024.
