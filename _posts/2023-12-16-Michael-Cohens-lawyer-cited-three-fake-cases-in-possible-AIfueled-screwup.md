> A lawyer representing Donald Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen filed
a court brief that cited three cases that do not exist, according to a
federal judge. "While several cases were cited in the initial Motion filed
by different counsel, undersigned counsel was not engaged at that time and
must inform the Court that it has been unable to verify those citations,"
Perry wrote. In May, a federal judge in the same District Court imposed a
$5,000 fine on two lawyers and their law firm after they admitted to using
ChatGPT to help write court filings that cited six nonexistent cases
invented by the AI chatbot.

And what about all the times that this goes undetected?
