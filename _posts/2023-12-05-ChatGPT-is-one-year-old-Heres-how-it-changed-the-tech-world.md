> One year ago today, on November 30, 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT. It's
uncommon for a single product to create as much impact on the tech industry
as ChatGPT has in just one year. From a tech point of view, ChatGPT didn't
initially strike many as being especially novel, among those paying
attention to AI. Chatbots had existed for some time. Out of the box,
ChatGPT refused to answer some inflammatory questions, and as wily users
looking for social media points worked around each limitation, OpenAI
erected new guard rails to keep ChatGPT in line.
