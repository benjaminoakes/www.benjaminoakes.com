It uses the Amazon App Store, for many good reasons. That said, this clearly disincentivizes Windows app development (why not just make an Android app instead?), so I wonder what the long term strategy is.

I hope Microsoft puts more effort into web based technologies like PWAs. That's much more in their best interests.
