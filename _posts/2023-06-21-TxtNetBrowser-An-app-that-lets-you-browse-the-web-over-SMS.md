>TextNet Browser is an Android app that allows anyone around the world to browse the web without a mobile data connection! It uses SMS as a medium of transmitting HTTP requests to a server where a pre-parsed HTML response is compressed using Google's Brotli compression algorithm and encoded using a custom Base-114 encoding format (based on Basest).

A somewhat crazy idea that works. Worth installing now so that you can get a connection when you need it most. Sometimes SMS works and data doesn't.
