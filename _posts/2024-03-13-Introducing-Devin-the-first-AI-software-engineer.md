Well, I'm curious to see how this plays out, but given the quality of the blog (just titled "Blog" and with no permalinks to posts), I suspect humans will be involved in software engineering for a while still.

This is more likely to wipe out junior roles than senior roles at its current level of development, but it's hard to say what this will look like a few years out.
