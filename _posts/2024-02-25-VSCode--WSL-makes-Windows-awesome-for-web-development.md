>It's wild how we've come full circle. Microsoft was the top villain of the late 1990s for everyone I knew in tech, and Apple was the underdog darling. Now it's the other way around. Switching to OSX in 2001 felt like the rebel move. Now daring to run Windows in 2024 would make you the odd one out in a lot of communities. I for one hope to see a bunch of Windows machines, maybe even Framework laptops, at tech conferences going forward.
