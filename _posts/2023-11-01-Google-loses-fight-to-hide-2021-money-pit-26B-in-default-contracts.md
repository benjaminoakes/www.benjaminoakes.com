> Raghavan's testimony for the first time revealed that Google paid $26.3
billion in 2021 for default agreements, seemingly investing in default
status for its search engine while raking in $146.4 billion in revenue from
search advertising that year. Raghavan cited research "That found that
Americans spend about 23 minutes a day surfing the web, versus almost four
hours using applications," The Times reported, and noted that if Google
loses young users, research showed the threat gets bigger. Google has
planned a three-week presentation of its defense, The New York Times
reported, and Raghavan's testimony has set the stage for Google CEO Sundar
Pichai, who will testify on Monday.
