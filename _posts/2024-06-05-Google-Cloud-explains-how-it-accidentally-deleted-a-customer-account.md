> Earlier this month, Google Cloud experienced one of its biggest blunders
ever when UniSuper, a $135 billion Australian pension fund, had its Google
Cloud account wiped out due to some kind of mistake on Google's end. During
the initial deployment of a Google Cloud VMware Engine Private Cloud for
the customer using an internal tool, there was an inadvertent
misconfiguration of the GCVE service by Google operators due to leaving a
parameter blank. Google says, "No customer notification was sent because
the deletion was triggered as a result of a parameter being left blank by
Google operators using the internal tool, and not due to a customer
deletion request. Any customer-initiated deletion would have been preceded
by a notification to the customer."
