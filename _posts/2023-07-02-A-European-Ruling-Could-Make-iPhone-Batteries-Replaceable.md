title: "A European Ruling Could Make iPhone Batteries Replaceable"

> A recent ruling by the European Parliament seeks to impose stricter rules
about how the batteries inside devices like phones, tablets, and other
mobile electronics are made and disposed of. The company has a history of
making its batteries difficult to replace and has taken flak for hitting
users with dubious battery service alerts when trying to repair their own
batteries. The ruling would also require companies to more diligently
manage battery waste and use recycled components in the creation of new
batteries.
