>Orca is, for now, the largest installation in the infant "direct air capture" industry, which aims to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. When sealed underground such CO2 counts as "negative emissions" -- an essential but underdeveloped method for tackling global warming. To stop temperatures rising by 1.5C or even 2C above pre-industrial averages, as per the Paris climate agreement, hundreds or thousands of billions of tonnes of CO2 will have to be removed from the atmosphere in the second half of the century.
