> If you are looking for a specific type of result, like a bookmark or tag, you can speed up the process of finding it by typing in special characters after each search term in the address bar separated by spaces:
> 
>   - Add `^` to search for matches in your browsing history.
>   - Add `*` to search for matches in your bookmarks.
>   - Add `+` to search for matches in pages you've tagged.
>   - Add `%` to search for matches in your currently open tabs.
>   - Add `~` to search for matches in pages you've typed.
>   - Add `#` to search for matches in page titles.
>   - Add `@` to search for matches in web addresses (URLs).
>   - Add `$` to search for matches in suggestions. 
> 
> For example, if you're looking for a page you bookmarked called Mozilla Firefox Support, you might type mozilla. The autocomplete results appear, but might not show the page you want.
> 
> You can narrow your results down to bookmarks only by making your search string `mozilla *`.
> 
> If you still have too many results, you can further restrict the search by making your search string `mozilla * support #`. Now the autocomplete list will only show bookmarked pages with `mozilla` and `support` in the page title.

I've been using Firefox for a very long time and just only now discovered these shortcuts.  They appear to work on Firefox for Android as well.
