> Many modern websites have designs that are incompatible with Internet Explorer (IE). When an IE user visits an incompatible public website, the user may get a message. The message states that the website is incompatible with the browser. After the message is displayed, the user is expected to manually switch to a modern browser. To minimize disruptions, starting with version 84, Microsoft Edge supports a new capability that automatically redirects users. When an IE user navigates to a website that is incompatible with IE, Windows automatically redirects the user to Microsoft Edge.

This seems like something that should be in the page markup rather than requiring an email to Microsoft, but at least there's an option.
