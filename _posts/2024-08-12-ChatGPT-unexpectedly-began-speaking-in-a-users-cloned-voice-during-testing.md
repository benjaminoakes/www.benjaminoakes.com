> Among other examples, the document reveals that in rare occurrences
during testing, the model's Advanced Voice Mode unintentionally imitated
users' voices without permission. Advanced Voice Mode is a feature of
ChatGPT that allows users to have spoken conversations with the AI
assistant. In a section of the GPT-4o system card titled "Unauthorized
voice generation," OpenAI details an episode where a noisy input somehow
prompted the model to suddenly imitate the user's voice.
