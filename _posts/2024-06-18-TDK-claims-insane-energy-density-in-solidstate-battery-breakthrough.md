> Japan's TDK is claiming a breakthrough in materials used in its small
solid-state batteries, with the Apple supplier predicting significant
performance increases for devices from wireless headphones to smartwatches.
The new material provides an energy density-the amount that can be squeezed
into a given space-of 1,000 watt-hours per liter, which is about 100 times
greater than TDK's current battery in mass production. The breakthrough is
the latest step forward for a technology industry experts think can
revolutionize energy storage, but which faces significant obstacles on the
path to mass production, particularly at larger battery sizes.
