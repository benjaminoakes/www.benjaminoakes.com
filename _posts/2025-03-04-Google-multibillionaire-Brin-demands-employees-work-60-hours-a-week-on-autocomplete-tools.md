>Sergey Brin, one of the original co-founders of Google who seems to spend most of his time not working at Google, has sent out a company-wide memo demanding everyone working at Google puts in at least 60 hours a week, in the office, to work on "AI" that will eventually replace the very employees he's demanding work 60 hours a week in the office. Mind you, this is the same Google that has just gone through several rounds of layoffs and made $26.3 billion in profit in a single quarter.

My comment: 

>This is irresponsible. I hope Googlers can find fulfilling careers elsewhere.

> As an LLM skeptic and software engineer, though, there is some impressive stuff out there. Its good to have an open mind. I recently got an agentic LLM to do quite a bit of useful busywork for me. It refactored and rewrote the way I requested with 95% accuracy. As someone who recently started a company, getting this work done for pennies is great. Its not challenging, yet it still needs to be done. Also, you still have to know what youre doing, of course. Even so, theres more than nothing to this tech. Are LLMs worth as much as theyre hyped to be? No. But theres definitely still something.
