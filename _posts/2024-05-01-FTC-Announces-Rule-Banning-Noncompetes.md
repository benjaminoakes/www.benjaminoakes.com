> Today, the Federal Trade Commission issued a final rule to promote
competition by banning noncompetes nationwide, protecting the fundamental
freedom of workers to change jobs, increasing innovation, and fostering new
business formation. The FTC estimates that the final rule banning
noncompetes will lead to new business formation growing by 2.7% per year,
resulting in more than 8,500 additional new businesses created each year.
In the final rule, the Commission has determined that it is an unfair
method of competition, and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC
Act, for employers to enter into noncompetes with workers and to enforce
certain noncompetes.
