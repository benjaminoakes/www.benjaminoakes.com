>Back in 2016, the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP) in Seattle unveiled an immersive new exhibit, Star Trek: Exploring New Worlds, in its Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame. The exhibit is a tribute to the hugely influential long-running franchise, and it embarked on a national tour two years later. Exploring New Worlds has been exploring the country ever since, and now it has come to the final stop on its journey: the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, California, where Gene Roddenberry first created his visionary series, Star Trek: The Original Series (TOS).

I saw this at MoPOP.  Highly recommended!
