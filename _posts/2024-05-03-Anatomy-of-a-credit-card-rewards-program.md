> In Europe, card acceptance is cheap by regulatory fiat and so rewards are
far less common than in the U.S. Similarly, debit card rewards used to be
fairly common in the United States until the Dodd-Frank Act capped debit
card interchange. We can see that, even scoping to credit cards in the
United States, not every card is a rewards card. Chase got Visa to
authorize Chase charging almost the entire economy more for credit card
acceptance with the specific goal of outcompeting American Express for the
most lucrative highest-monthly-spend virtually-never-revolve-a-balance
credit card users.
