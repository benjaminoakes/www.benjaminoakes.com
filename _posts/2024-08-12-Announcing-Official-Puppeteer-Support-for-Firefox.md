> We're pleased to announce that, as of version 23, the Puppeteer browser
automation library now has first-class support for Firefox. Whilst the
features offered by Puppeteer won't be a surprise, bringing support to
multiple browsers has been a significant undertaking. The Firefox support
is not based on a Firefox-specific automation protocol, but on WebDriver
BiDi, a cross browser protocol that's undergoing standardization at the
W3C, and currently has implementation in both Gecko and Chromium.
