> On Wednesday, Cambridge Dictionary announced that its 2023 word of the
year is "hallucinate," owing to the popularity of large language models
(LLMs) like ChatGPT, which sometimes produce erroneous information. The
Dictionary also published an illustrated site explaining the term, saying,
"When an artificial intelligence hallucinates, it produces false
