title: "Just How Much Faster Are the GNOME 46 Terminals?"

> Since the intention is to compare GNOME 45 to GNOME 46, I used toolbx
containers with Fedora 39 and Fedora 40 to install and run all terminals
above, as packaged by Fedora with no extra tweaks. Look at the massive
improvement on all of the VTE terminals! They went from quite bad to pretty
much on par with Alacritty, even the GTK 3 GNOME Terminal is very close.
The massive improvement is clear on this test too, and our GNOME 46
terminals are still pretty much on par with Alacritty!

Good, because Alacritty is a bit barebones.
