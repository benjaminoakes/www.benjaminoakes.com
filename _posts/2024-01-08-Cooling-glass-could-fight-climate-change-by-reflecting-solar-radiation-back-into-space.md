> As the world continues to experience a worsening climate crisis with
record-breaking temperatures, scientists have developed a new, highly
reflective glass coating that may help cool a rapidly warming Earth.
Laboratory tests have shown it to reflect up to 99 percent of solar
radiation back into space. Cooler weather created by the cooling effect of
the glass and/or other climate change-fighting measures could help create
would then prompt people to reduce using air conditioners, Zhao told
Space.com.
