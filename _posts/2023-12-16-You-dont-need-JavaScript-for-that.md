> In contrast to JS, which is imperative, HTML and CSS are declarative. You
tell the browser what to do, not how to do it. That means the browser gets
to choose how to do it, and it can do it in the most efficient way possible.
>
> Because HTML and CSS features are handled by the browser they can be more
performant, more native, more adaptable to user preferences and in general,
more accessible. That doesn't mean it will always be (especially when it
comes to accessibility) but when the browser does the heavy lifting for
you, your end users will generally have a better experience.
