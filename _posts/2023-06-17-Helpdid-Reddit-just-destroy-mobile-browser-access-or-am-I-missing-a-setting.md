>I'm logged in on my phone (iOS) but I use a browser, not the app. As of an hour ago, the mobile view is showing that I'm logged out, with no option to log in and a permanent "this looks better in the app" banner on the page. If I request the desktop website, it shows that I'm still logged in and I can post, though it's almost entirely non-functional for browsing. Is there some setting that I haven't yet found to correct this, or did they make a change to essentially disable Reddit for phone users without the app?

Why are they trying so hard to make it difficult to want to like Reddit?
