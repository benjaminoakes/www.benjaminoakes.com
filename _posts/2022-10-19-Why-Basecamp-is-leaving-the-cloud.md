>Basecamp has had one foot in the cloud for well over a decade, and HEY has been running there exclusively since it was launched two years ago. We've run extensively in both Amazon's cloud and Google's cloud. We've run on bare virtual machines, we've run on Kubernetes. We've seen all the cloud has to offer, and tried most of it. It's finally time to conclude: Renting computers is (mostly) a bad deal for medium-sized companies like ours with stable growth. The savings promised in reduced complexity never materialized. So we're making our plans to leave.

I'm curious to see where this leads.  I've sometimes wondered about the "middle lifespan" of a product where providers like AWS don't actually add a ton of value relative to the cost.  But will DHH be back in a year saying this was a bad idea?  Or will they save money over the long term?
