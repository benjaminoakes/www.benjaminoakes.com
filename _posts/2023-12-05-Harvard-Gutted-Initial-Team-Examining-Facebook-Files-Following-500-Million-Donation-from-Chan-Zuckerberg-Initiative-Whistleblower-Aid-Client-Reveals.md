> WASHINGTON, D.C. - Harvard University dismantled its prestigious team of
online disinformation experts after a foundation run by Facebook's Mark
Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $500 million to the
university, a whistleblower disclosure filed by Whistleblower Aid reveals.
In her whistleblower declaration, Donovan lays out in detail how she and
her research team at Harvard's Kennedy School came under sudden scrutiny
from the school's dean, Douglas Elmendorf, and other Kennedy School
leaders, after they started working on Haugen's Facebook Files - a cache
Donovan describes as "The most important documents in the history of the
internet." Suddenly her work became a threat to some of HKS's most
treasured donor relationships - just as Harvard was finalizing the largest
donation the school had ever received, $500 million from the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative in December 2021.
