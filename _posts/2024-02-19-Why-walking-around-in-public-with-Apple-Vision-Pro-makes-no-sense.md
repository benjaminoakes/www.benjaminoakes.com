title: "Why walking around in public with Apple Vision Pro makes no sense"

> If you've spent any time in the tech-enthusiast corners of Instagram of
TikTok over the past few weeks, you've seen the videos: so-called tech bros
strolling through public spaces with confidence, donning Apple's $3,500
Vision Pro headset on their faces while gesturing into the air. Over the
next few weeks, I'm going all-in on trying the Vision Pro in all sorts of
situations to see which ones it suits. I'm setting out to answer a few
questions here: Does it feel weird wearing it in public spaces? Will people
judge you or react negatively when you wear it-and if so, will that become
less common over time? Does it truly disconnect you from reality, and has
Apple succeeded in solving virtual reality's isolationist tendencies? Does
it provide enough value to be worth wearing?
