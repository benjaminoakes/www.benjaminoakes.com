> At around 7:30 pm local time today, internet monitoring firm NetBlocks
confirmed a "Collapse" in connectivity in the Gaza Strip, mostly impacting
remaining Paltel services. "We regret to announce a complete interruption
of all communications and internet services within the Gaza Strip," Paltel
posted in a post on its Facebook page. A WIRED review of internet analysis
data, social media posts, and Palestinian internet and telecom company
statements shows how connectivity in the Gaza Strip drastically plummeted
after October 7 and how some buildings linked to internet firms have been
damaged in attacks.
