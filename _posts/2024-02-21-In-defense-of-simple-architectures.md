> There are some kinds of applications that have demands that would make a
simple monolith on top of a boring database a non-starter but, for most
kinds of applications, even at top-100 site levels of traffic, computers
are fast enough that high-traffic apps can be served with simple
architectures, which can generally be created more cheaply and easily than
complex architectures. Despite the unreasonable effectiveness of simple
architectures, most press goes to complex architectures. At a recent
generalist tech conference, there were six talks on how to build or deal
with side effects of complex, microservice-based, architectures and zero on
how one might build out a simple monolith.
