> The so-called SREN bill would require web browsers - like Mozilla's
Firefox - to block websites in the browsers themselves. It would set a
dangerous precedent, providing a playbook for other governments to also
turn browsers like Firefox into censorship tools. Add your name to our
petition to help stop this part of the bill from becoming law.

I'm sure there are some good arguments for censorship, but this is
concerning.  I'm a bit surprised that France wants to ban books... erm, I
mean, websites.
