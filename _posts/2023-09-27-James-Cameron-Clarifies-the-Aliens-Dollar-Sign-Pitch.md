> The thing I love about James Cameron is that he has some legendary
stories. One of my favorite Cameron stories goes like this: he walked into
an office in Fox and wrote "Alien$" on a chalkboard, and the studio
green-lit the movie. In an all-encompassing article from Empire Magazine,
James Cameron confronted that legendary meeting.

I haven't seen this movie in a very long time! James Cameron is certainly
capable of massive success at the box office as we've seen again and again.
