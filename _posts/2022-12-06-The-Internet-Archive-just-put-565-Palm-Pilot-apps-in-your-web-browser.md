>Yes, I am playing Dope Wars on a Palm Pilot inside my iPhone. Its thanks to The Internet Archive, which is once again launching a giant collection of software you can instantly play on any web browser, up to and including your touchscreen-equipped phone. There are currently 565 classic Palm apps in all, including games, widgets, and even free trials from both the greyscale and color eras.

This works surprisingly well.  I kind of miss the Palm OS era, when handheld apps were more focused.
