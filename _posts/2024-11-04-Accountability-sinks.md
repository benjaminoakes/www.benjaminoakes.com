>In The Unaccountability Machine, Dan Davies argues that organizations form "accountability sinks," structures that absorb or obscure the consequences of a decision such that no one can be held directly accountable for it. Here's an example: a higher up at a hospitality company decides to reduce the size of its cleaning staff, because it improves the numbers on a balance sheet somewhere. Later, you are trying to check into a room, but it's not ready and the clerk can't tell you when it will be; they can offer a voucher, but what you need is a room. There's no one to call to complain, no way to communicate back to that distant leader that they've scotched your plans. The accountability is swallowed up into a void, lost forever.
