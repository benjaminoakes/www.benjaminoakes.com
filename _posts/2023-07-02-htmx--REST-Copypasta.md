>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as REST, is in fact, JSON/RPC, or as I've recently taken to calling it, REST-less. JSON is not a hypermedia unto itself, but rather a plain data format made useful by out of band information as defined by swagger documentation or similar.

Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of REST which is widely used today is often called "The Web", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the REST-ful architecture, defined by Roy Fielding.

JSON is an essential part of Single Page Applications, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete API specification. JSON is normally used in combination with SPA libraries: the whole system is basically RPC with JSON added, or JSON/RPC. All these so-called "REST-ful" APIs are really JSON/RPC.

At least slightly passive aggressive, but also true. Everyone seems to think REST is some weird theory rather than a formal description of the web.
