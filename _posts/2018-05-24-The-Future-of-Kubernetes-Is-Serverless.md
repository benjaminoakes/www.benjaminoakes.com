> The development of containers changed all of that, de-coupling developer experience from serverless runtimes. It is no surprise then that the past year has seen the development of serverless container infrastructure. Last July Azure released Azure Container Instances, the first serverless container offering in a major public cloud, though in fairness the folks at hyper.sh were already in the market. Seeing significant user interest in serverless infrastructure other public clouds followed Azure's lead, with Fargate being announced six months later at RE:Invent 2017, and I believe its only a matter of time before serverless container infrastructure is available in all public clouds.
