 > As we've previously reported, the three 1928 Mickey Mouse cartoons 
were due to enter the public domain much earlier (on January 1, 1999), 
but due to the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act passed in 1998, 
that date was pushed back 25 years. It's worth noting that this public 
domain admission doesn't cover later versions of Mickey, and using the 
Mickey Mouse name commercially still has trademark implications. Expect 
those issues to be tested thoroughly over time now that the American 
public "owns" an early version of Mickey.

This is huge for copyright.
