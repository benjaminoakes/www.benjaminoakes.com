> On February 15, Oral-B bricked the Guide's ability to set up Alexa by
discontinuing the Oral-B Connect app required to complete the process. The
Oral-B Guide still has Alexa built-in and customers can keep using the
Alexa experience on devices that were set up through the Oral-B Connect
app. Oral-B discontinued the Guide about two years ago and now only has one
mobile app, called Oral-B. If a toothbrush brand is going to have any apps
at all, one seems like the maximum reasonable number.

Anything that needs an app to work will eventually be abandoned and cease
to work in some way
