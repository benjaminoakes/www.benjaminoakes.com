> Vega would replace the Fire OS that is installed on Fire TV sticks and
televisions, Kindle Fire tablets, and other Amazon devices. This could
simplify development for Fire devices alongside other React-ready
platforms, including smartphones, desktops, and other smart TVs. Fire OS is
a fork of Android based on the Android Open Source Project, but it's far
from the same thing. Amazon and Google struck a deal allowing for Fire TV
manufacturers like TCL to continue making TVs with Android TV and Fire TV
systems.

Very little of this plan makes real sense. It sounds like the Fire Phone or
Windows Phone, neither of which worked out.
