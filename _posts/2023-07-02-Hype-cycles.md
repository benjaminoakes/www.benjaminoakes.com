We've made this unnecessarily complicated. That said, I think the pendulum
is swinging back again...

I've tried to stay away from unnecessary thick clients, but they're
basically unavoidable right now, especially because of iOS.  There's just
so much complexity for so little value... but it's where users are.  I hope
we can simplify this situation. Thin clients are a great choice for a huge
number of applications.

I'm still very curious to see what [Strada](https://hotwired.dev/) looks
like, if it ever releases.
