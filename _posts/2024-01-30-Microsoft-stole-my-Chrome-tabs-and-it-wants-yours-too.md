title: "Microsoft stole my Chrome tabs, and it wants yours, too"

> Last week, I turned on my PC, installed a Windows update, and rebooted to
find Microsoft Edge automatically open with the Chrome tabs I was working
on before the update. I dont use Microsoft Edge regularly, and I have
Google Chrome set as my default browser. Bleary-eyed at 9AM, it took me a
moment to realize that Microsoft Edge had simply taken over where Id left
off in Chrome. I couldnt believe my eyes.
>
> I never imported my data into Microsoft Edge, nor did I confirm whether I
wanted to import my tabs. But here was Edge automatically opening after a
Windows update with all the Chrome tabs Id been working on. I didnt even
realize I was using Edge at first, and I was confused why all my tabs were
suddenly logged out.

If this is true, it is not okay. I guess Microsoft is still Microsoft.
