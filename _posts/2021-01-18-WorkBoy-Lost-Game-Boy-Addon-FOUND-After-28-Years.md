I had no idea this ever existed.  It was an add-on to basically make the Game Boy into a PDA. It's not such a crazy idea when you consider how much computers and even PDAs cost back then, compared to the Game Boy. 

> A 30 year old single known prototype that can only interact with a 30 year old ROM that just so happened to have been recently leaked from Nintendo's official servers finally reunited and showcased for the world
>
> What a crazy story and set of finds

My thoughts exactly.  It'd be interesting to play with this, but ultimately not much more than a curiosity.
