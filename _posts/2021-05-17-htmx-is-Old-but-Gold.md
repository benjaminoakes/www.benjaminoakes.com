> htmx is this tool I have been flirting with for creating dynamic web applications. It is a heretical tool of sorts. Cutting my teeth, writing Javascript every day with the latest framework is something I have been doing day to day for the last 10 years. This tool (htmx) is a pragmatic choice for developing modern web applications using a technique that would be common in a web app from 2004. Our industry runs in a cycle, and this tool is the return of a productive and useful trend in my opinion.

Modern JavaScript is incredibly heavy for simple projects. I haven't tried HTMX, but it and it's ilk are intriguing.
