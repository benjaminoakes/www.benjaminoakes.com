>Just to clarify one thing, to preempt someone saying Apple did this on purpose to kill off Hackintosh: they didnt. Apple never cared about Hackintosh scene, its entirely irrelevant to their business. They did what they should be doing, improving the macOS codebase. Its always a good thing to remove obsolete and deprecated code thus Apple is doing the right thing for their product.

If these same people put the same amount of effort into improving desktop Linux, I wonder how different the world would be...
