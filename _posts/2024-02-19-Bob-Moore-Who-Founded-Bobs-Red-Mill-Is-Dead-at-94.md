> "I think that people who eat white flour, white rice, de-germinated corn
-- in other words, grains that have had part of their nutrients taken away
-- are coming up short," Mr. Moore said in 2017 in an interview for an
Oregon State University oral history. "I think our diets, nationally, and
international probably, show the fact that we just have allowed ourselves
to be sold a bill of goods."

> Despite the company's explosive growth, Mr. Moore fended off numerous
offers by food giants to buy Bob's Red Mill. He opted instead for an
employee stock ownership plan, instituted in 2010, on his 81st birthday; by
April 2020, the plan had put 100 percent of the company in the hands of its
more than 700 employees.
