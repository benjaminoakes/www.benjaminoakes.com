I've mostly been posting to Twitter through my RSS feed for quite some time.  Given that the future of Twitter is uncertain, please subscribe with an RSS reader.  I would recommend [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/), or [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/).

I have also made a Mastodon account: [@benjaminoakes@ruby.social](https://ruby.social/@benjaminoakes).  It will likely republish my RSS feed someday.  Mastodon is interesting and I've been aware of it for years, but it never seemed like it would become a serious contender.  It seems that may change.
