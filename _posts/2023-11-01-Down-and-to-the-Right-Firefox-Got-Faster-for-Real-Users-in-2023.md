> Our goal is to build performance tests that simulate real-world user
experiences so that browsers have better tools to drive improvements for
real users on real webpages. While it's easy to see that benchmarks have
improved in Firefox throughout the year as a result of this work, what we
really care about is how much those wins are being felt by our users. In
order to measure the user experience, Firefox collects a wide range of
anonymized timing metrics related to page load, responsiveness, startup and
other aspects of browser performance.
