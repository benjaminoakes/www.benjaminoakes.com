> The other day I was trying to write some HTML to give the user the
ability to reload the document in its exact state by clicking on a link.
"how do you reload an html document using the `<a>` tag and preserve query
parameters?". At that point, it seemed pretty inconceivable to me that
there was really no way to reload a document using only HTML that preserved
the state of the URL. So I turned to Mastodon and Twitter for help.

)

tl;dr: an empty string for your link, e.g. `<a href="">Reload</a>`

Good to know!
