> Prosecutors in their closing argument told the jury that Mr.
Bankman-Fried had built his crypto empire on a "Foundation of lies and
false promises." Judge Kaplan wants the government to let him know if a
planned second trial for Bankman-Fried on other charges of campaign finance
and foreign bribery will still be held. Nicolas Roos, a prosecutor, said
the second trial could have an impact on Bankman-Fried's sentencing date.
