> Reverse engineering, also called backwards engineering or back
engineering, is the process by which an artificial object is deconstructed
to reveal its designs, architecture, code, or to extract knowledge from the
object. This comprehensive set of reverse engineering tutorials covers x86,
x64 as well as 32-bit ARM and 64-bit architectures. As a beginner, these
tutorials will carry you from nothing upto the mid-basics of reverse
engineering, a skill that everyone within the realm of cyber-security
should possess.
