>As for his most famous role, Jones was paid $7,000 to lend his voice to Darth Vader in 1977's "Star Wars: A New Hope," but he declined screen credit for that film and its sequel, 1980's "The Empire Strikes Back," out of deference to the actor who played the role on screen, David Prowse. By 1983's "Return of the Jedi," however, Jones had become fully synonymous with one of the most memorable and terrifying villains in cinema history, and received credit for his work. He returned to Vader's voice again for 2005's "Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith" and 2016's "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," but for the 2022 Disney+ series "Obi-Wan Kenobi," Jones instead authorized Lucasfilm to use archival recordings and AI technology to recreate Vader's voice.

I'm not sure we should use people's voices after they pass away.  I know he authorized it and it's valuable, but give other actors a chance.
