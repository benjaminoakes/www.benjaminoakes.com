>As mentioned earlier, the browser handles HTML from the server in a very performant way by default.

This leads to a lower Total Blocking Time (TBT), and TBT is strongly correlated with INP.

I'm more and more dubious of JavaScript thick-clients.  This is Google writing this, and presumably with involvement from someone on the Chrome team.
