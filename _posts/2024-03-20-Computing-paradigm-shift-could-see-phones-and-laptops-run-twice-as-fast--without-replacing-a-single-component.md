Summary:

Scientists have developed a new computing method that could make devices like phones and laptops twice as fast without changing their parts. This method, called "simultaneous and heterogeneous multithreading" (SHMT), allows different processing units to work on the same part of a program at once, instead of one after the other. In tests, SHMT made a prototype system nearly twice as fast and used half the energy compared to traditional methods. However, more research is needed to see how it works in real-world situations.
