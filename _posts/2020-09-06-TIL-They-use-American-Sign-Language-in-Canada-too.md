[Nigel Howard Is Teaching UBC's First Ever ASL Program & You Can Join - Narcity](https://www.narcity.com/news/ca/bc/vancouver/nigel-howard-is-teaching-ubcs-first-ever-asl-program-you-can-join)

Today I learned: they use American Sign Language (ASL) in most of English speaking Canada. There is a separate sign language in French speaking Canada, which is ironic because ASL is based on French sign language. In the UK, they use British Sign Language.

Definitely an interesting parallel history.
