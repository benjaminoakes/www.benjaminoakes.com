Seen in the release notes for [the Target Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.target.ui):

>  - Find items that are better for you, your family and the planet with wellness badges. Cruelty free, plant-based and vegan are just a few of the icons youll see on product detail pages.

Nice!  Not sure how they evaluate this, but more mainstream awareness is great.
