This covers the topic in my post yesterday. I'm glad this possibility is getting more attention in mainstream media. The more people that are actively monitoring this situation, the higher the chance that any undemocratic outcomes will be completely prevented.

There will be some loud people making claims, but that's likely all that will really happen.  How many people come to believe those claims should be somewhat small (though much larger than makes sense).  I hope we can all move beyond this in short order.  If not, I hope we find a way to eventually convince 99% of people that this was a fair outcome.
