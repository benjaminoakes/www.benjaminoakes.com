> Late last month, those years of brushing off US regulators caught up with
the company in the form of one of the most punitive money-laundering
criminal settlements in the history of the US Justice Department. What was
once a haven for anarchic crypto commerce is about to be transformed into
the opposite: perhaps the most fed-friendly business in the cryptocurrency
industry, retroactively offering more than a half-decade of users'
transaction records to US regulators and law enforcement. Binance's
settlement agreements with the DOJ and the US Treasury Department also
stipulate a strict new regime of data-sharing with law enforcement and
regulators.
