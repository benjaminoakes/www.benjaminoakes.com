> On Wednesday, the UK hosted an AI Safety Summit attended by 28 countries,
including the US and China, which gathered to address potential risks posed
by advanced AI systems, reports The New York Times. In particular, the
declaration refers to what it calls "Frontier AI," which the document
vaguely defines as "Highly capable general-purpose AI models, including
foundation models, that could perform a wide variety of tasks-as well as
relevant specific narrow AI that could exhibit capabilities that cause
harm-which match or exceed the capabilities present in today's most
advanced models." The US, for its part, has announced a separate American
AI Safety Institute, and President Biden recently issued an executive order
on AI. The European Union is working on an AI bill to establish regulatory
principles and guidelines for specific AI technologies.
