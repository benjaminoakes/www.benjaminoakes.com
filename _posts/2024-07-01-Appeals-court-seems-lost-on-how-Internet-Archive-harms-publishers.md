title: "Appeals court seems lost on how Internet Archive harms publishers"

> The Internet Archive went before a three-judge panel Friday to defend its
open library's controlled digital lending practices after book publishers
last year won a lawsuit claiming that the archive's lending violated
copyright law. During a press briefing following arguments in court Friday,
IA founder Brewster Kahle said that "Those voices weren't being heard."
Judges appeared primarily focused on understanding how IA's digital lending
potentially hurts publishers' profits in the ebook licensing market, rather
than on how publishers' costly ebook licensing potentially harms readers.
Should the court decide otherwise, McSherry warned, the court risks
allowing "a few powerful publishers" to "Hijack the future of books."
