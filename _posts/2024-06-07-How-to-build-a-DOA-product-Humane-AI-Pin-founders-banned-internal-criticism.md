title: "How to build a DOA product: Humane AI Pin founders banned internal criticism"

> The Humane AI Pin has launched, crashed, and burned, with founders
already looking to sell the company just one month after launch. How bad
does it have to be for founders to want to exit the company? The report
says, "As of early April, Humane had received around 10,000 orders for the
AI Pin, a small fraction of the 100,000 that it hoped to sell this year,
two people familiar with its sales said." At $700 each, if all of those
orders were filled, that's around $7 million in revenue, plus whatever the
subscription retention is. The two founders apparently "Preferred
positivity over criticism, leading them to disregard warnings about the AI
Pin's poor battery life and power consumption. A senior software engineer
was dismissed after raising questions about the product, they said, while
others left out of frustration." After that software engineer was fired for
questioning if the AI pin would be ready for launch, the report describes a
staff meeting where the founders "Said the employee had violated policy by
talking negatively about Humane." It's hard to make a good product if you
can't honestly talk about the negatives and positives for fear of
retaliation.
