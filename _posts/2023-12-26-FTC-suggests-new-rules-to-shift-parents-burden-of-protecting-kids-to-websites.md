> The Federal Trade Commission is currently seeking comments on new rules that would further restrict platforms' efforts to monetize children's data. Through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, the FTC initially sought to give parents more control over what kinds of information that various websites and apps can collect from their kids. Now, the FTC wants to update COPPA and "Shift the burden from parents to providers to ensure that digital services are safe and secure for children," the FTC's press release said.
