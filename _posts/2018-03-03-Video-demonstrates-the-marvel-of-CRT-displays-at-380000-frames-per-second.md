> When the capture frame rate hits 380,000 frames per second while recording Super Mario Bros. playing on an NES and a CRT TV, the video shows the image drawing not just vertically, one scan line at a time, but one pixel at a time as it builds out each scanline from left to right. It all happens so quickly that the naked eye can't tell, even on that old hardware.
