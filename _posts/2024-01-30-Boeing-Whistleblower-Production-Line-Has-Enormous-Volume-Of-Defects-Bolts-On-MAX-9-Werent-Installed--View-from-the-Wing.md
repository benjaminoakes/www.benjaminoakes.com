> A reader at respected airline industry site Leeham News offered a comment
that suggests they have access to Boeings internal quality control
systems, and shares details of what they saw regarding the Boeing 737 MAX 9
flown by Alaska Airlines that had a door plug detach inflight, causing
rapid decompression of the aircraft.  The takeaway appears to be that
outsourced plane components have so many problems when they show up at the
production line that Boeings quality control staff cant keep up with them
all.

I've read that Boeing is no longer an engineering-led company.
