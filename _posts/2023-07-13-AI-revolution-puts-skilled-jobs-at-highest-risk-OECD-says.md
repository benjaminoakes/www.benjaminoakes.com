title: "AI revolution puts skilled jobs at highest risk, OECD says"

> The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the
occupations at highest risk from AI-driven automation were highly skilled
jobs and represented about 27% of employment across its 38 member
countries, which include the UK, Japan, Germany, the US, Australia and
Canada. "These rapid developments, combined with the falling costs of
producing and adopting these new technologies, suggest that OECD economies
may be on the cusp of an AI revolution which could fundamentally change the
workplace," the organisation said in its 2023 employment outlook, which
refers to an "Urgent need to act" on AI. The Paris-based body said: "Urgent
action is required to make sure AI is used responsibly and in a trustworthy
way in the workplace." The OECD said data indicated that economies were on
the "Brink" of a revolution rather than being in midst of one, with the
share of firms that had adopted AI remaining in the single digits, due in
part to issues related to cost and workforce skills.

I mean, maybe?  Right now using a GPT is like having an assistant that
sometimes does great, but also sometimes does very poorly. Other times, it
straight up lies to you. If used well, sure, this could eliminate some
jobs, but it's not magically as good as a skilled human.
