> When I did, I learned that Windows has turned into a wonderful web
developer's platform thanks to the Windows Subsystem for Linux. I'm not
going to lie and say I loved everything about Windows. I still have Windows
available as a dual-boot option on the desktop, but the Framework 13 has
been running Ubuntu exclusively the whole time, it's my daily driver at the
moment, and now that I've acclimated, Linux just feels right.

It feels like this was always going to happen.  DHH might go back to macOS
eventually, but I hope that desktop Linux gets better during his time using
it.
