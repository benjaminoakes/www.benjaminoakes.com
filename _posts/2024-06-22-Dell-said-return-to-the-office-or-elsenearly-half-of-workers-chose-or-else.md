> Workers stayed remote even when told they could no longer be promoted.
>
> Big tech companies are still trying to rally workers back into physical
offices, and many workers are still not having it. In the new plan, workers
had to classify themselves as remote or hybrid. Advertisement Others still

teams they worked on were already distributed across multiple offices
around the world, so they'd mostly still be on Zoom calls anyway.
