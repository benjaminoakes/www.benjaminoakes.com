title: "If AI is making the Turing test obsolete, what might be better?"

> The current generations of AI programs, such as Google's LaMDA and
OpenAI's ChatGPT, for example, have come close to passing the Turing Test,
yet the test results don't imply these programs can think and reason like
humans. In addition to this, the Turing Test fails to analyze an AI
program's ability to think. "It's unclear whether passing the Turing Test
is a meaningful milestone or not. It doesn't tell us anything about what a
system can do or understand, anything about whether it has established
complex inner monologues or can engage in planning over abstract time
horizons, which is key to human intelligence," Mustafa Suleyman, an AI
expert and founder of DeepAI, told Bloomberg.
