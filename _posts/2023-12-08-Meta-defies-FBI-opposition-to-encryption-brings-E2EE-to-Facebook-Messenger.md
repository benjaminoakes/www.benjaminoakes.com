> "Today I'm delighted to announce that we are rolling out default
end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls on Messenger and
Facebook," Meta VP of Messenger Loredana Crisan wrote yesterday. Meta held
firm, telling Ars in April that "We don't think people want us reading
their private messages" and that the plan to make end-to-end encryption the
default in Facebook Messenger would be completed before the end of 2023.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2019 that the company planned to "Implement
end-to-end encryption across all of our messaging services." The Meta-owned
WhatsApp already had end-to-end encryption enabled by default, and users
could enable the security technology on Messenger.
