>For now, it feels like we've been given a preview of a possible future mode of software development--or interface design, at the very least--where creating a working prototype is as simple as making a visual mock-up and having an AI model do the rest. As developer Michael Dubakov wrote when showing off his own Make It Real creation, "OK, @tldraw is officially insane. It is really interesting where we end up in 5 years... I can't keep up with innovation pace anymore."

This is certainly impressive. However, I've only really ever seen it hyped up using relatively simple greenfield examples. Sure, it can make a timer or breakout game, but there's a lot more to software development than just what's shown. 

I'm very curious to see where this goes.
