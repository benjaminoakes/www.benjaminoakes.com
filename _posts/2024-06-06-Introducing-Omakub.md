> Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best. Omakub
includes a curated set of applications and tools that one might discover
through hours of watching YouTube, reading blogs, or just stumbling around
Linux internet. Having good, curated defaults that integrate all the many
tools in a coherent feel and look can help more developers acquire a taste
for Linux, which they may then later inspire a fully bespoke setup.
