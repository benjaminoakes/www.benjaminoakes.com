The correspondence between entanglement and computing came as a jolt to many researchers.

I remember wondering about this when I read about quantum physics recently (in Quantum Physics for Babies, of all things).  Certainly not in as much detail as these researchers did, but it's very interesting that just a number of months later this proof was published. I'm honestly still digesting it.
