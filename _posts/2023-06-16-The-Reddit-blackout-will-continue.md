From the comments:

>The first 10 years of the internet were volunteers creating for other volunteers. The next 10 was volunteers for 'users'. The last 10, for corporations.
>
> The commons built in the 90s was turned into a playground in the 2000s and is now a oil well being mined by megacorps.
>
> What, I hope, interest rates are doing is shifting the balance of power to its natural point: the commons is owned by the volunteers. Megacorp's ability to profit from this was a disguise created by free money.

Very interested to see where this goes. Mastodon was ready to go when Twitter was purchased. Will a Reddit clone rise to the top?  Maybe a federated one?  Maybe even blogs will make a comeback...
