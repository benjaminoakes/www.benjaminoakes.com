>Having been unable to renew its contract with Google for Youtube TV, more bad news popped up for users today. Due to yet another expiring contract and the aforementioned continued strain on the business relationship, the Youtube app itself will no longer be able to be installed on new Roku devices as of December 9, 2021.

This is so stupid. We bought some content from Google Play recently and can now only play it on YouTube on the Roku and soon that will be going away because of their bickering. This only makes me think twice about buying more content from Google. This is not a good look and I have to wonder what these people are thinking.

I've thought about getting a Chromecast for years, but this is not the way to get me to want to do that.
