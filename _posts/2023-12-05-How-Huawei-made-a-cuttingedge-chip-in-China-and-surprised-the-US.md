> Nearly three years later, in August 2023, a new Huawei device was quietly
unveiled to the public: the Mate 60 series phone, powered by Charlotte-now
known as the Kirin 9000S chip. In the US, confusion reigned about how
Huawei had overcome sanctions to produce the chips. Jake Sullivan, US
national security adviser, said that America needed to get "More
information" about the Kirin 9000S. "Perhaps the most surprising fact about
the Huawei breakthrough is that so many US government leaders were
evidently surprised," Gregory Allen, director of Wadhwani Center for AI and
Advanced Technologies, wrote in an in-depth report about Huawei's new phone.
