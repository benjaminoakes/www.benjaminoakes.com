title: "\"Renew Home\" company brings power grid data to your smart home"

> The first existing service getting pulled into Renew Home is Nest Renew.
This service for Nest Thermostats uses power company data to tell consumers
how their electricity is being generated and what it costs. That data lets
your thermostat do things like automatically shift heating and cooling to
times of day when energy is cheaper or cleaner, and shows various reports
about the cleanness of the energy you've been using. (Nest's feature that
lets utility companies remotely take control of your thermostat, Rush Hour
Rewards, does not seem to be part of Renew Home.)

I would happily shift usage or alternate air conditioning with my
neighbors.
