> Eric Migicovsky, co-founder of the all-in-one messaging service Beeper,
says Beeper Mini can do this because iMessage has been reverse-engineered.
The script worked, so Beeper hired the researcher and, over the last three
months, completely rewrote their client into this new Mini app. At the
moment, Beeper Mini supports group chats, high-resolution images and video
and voice messages, stickers and GIFs, reply threads, and
sent/delivered/read/typing status.
