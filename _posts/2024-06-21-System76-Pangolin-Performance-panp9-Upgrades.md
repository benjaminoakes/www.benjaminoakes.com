I have a System76 Pangolin Performance (panp9) that's about _12 years old_.  It's still doing pretty well, too!  That said, more RAM and an SSD could help it run a bit faster and they seem to be pretty cheap.

I searched online for details about upgrading but didn't find much, so I submitted a ticket to System76.  (After all, they offer lifetime support!)

I thought I'd share what I heard back in case it can help someone else.

It uses a SATA SSD slot so there really isn't a hard limit as to how big of an SSD you can install; you should be able to grab whichever SATA drive you want and use it. Other than that there aren't really any other impactful upgrades that can be done.
