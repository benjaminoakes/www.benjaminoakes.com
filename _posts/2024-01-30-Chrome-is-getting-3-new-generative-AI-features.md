>Three experimental generative AI features are coming to Chrome on Macs and
Windows PCs to make browsing easier and more personalized.

> Starting with today's release of Chrome, we're introducing experimental
generative AI features to make it even easier and more efficient to browse
- all while keeping your experience personalized to you. Quick reminder: In
addition to AI-generated themes, you can also customize Chrome with photos
you've uploaded or themes from our collections in the Chrome Web Store,
including ones commissioned from a growing community of artists. Look out
for more ways we're bringing AI and ML into Chrome this year, including
integrating our new AI model Gemini, to help you browse even easier and
faster.
