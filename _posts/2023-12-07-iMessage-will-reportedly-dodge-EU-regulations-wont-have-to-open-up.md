title: "iMessage will reportedly dodge EU regulations, won't have to open up"

> Roid users' hopes that Apple's iMessage would be forced to open up in the
European Union have been dashed. Google recently rolled out a campaign to
implore the EU to qualify iMessage for regulation, as Android's iMessage
incompatibility is a big deal in the US. iMessage hasn't made the list and
that's despite meeting the popularity metrics of 45 million monthly active
EU users. Qualifying for the law would have forced iMessage to allow
interoperability with other services, so theoretically, you'd be allowed to
log in to iMessage from WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and whatever else.

At least there's RCS?  And I suspect Apple is adding RCS support
specifically to avoid litigation.
