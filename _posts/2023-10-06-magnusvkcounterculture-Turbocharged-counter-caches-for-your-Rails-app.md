>Turbo-charged counter caches for your Rails app. Huge improvements over the Rails standard counter caches:
>
>- Updates counter cache when values change, not just when creating and destroying
>- Supports counter caches through multiple levels of relations
>- Supports dynamic column names, making it possible to split up the counter cache for different types of objects
>- Can keep a running count, or a running total
