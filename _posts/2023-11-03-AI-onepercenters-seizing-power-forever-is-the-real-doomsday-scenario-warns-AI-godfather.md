> AI godfather Yann LeCun wants us to forget some of the more far-fetched
doomsday scenarios. He named OpenAI's Sam Altman, Google DeepMind's Demis
Hassabis, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei in a lengthy weekend post on X.
"Altman, Hassabis, and Amodei are the ones doing massive corporate lobbying
at the moment," LeCun wrote, referring to these founders' role in shaping
regulatory conversations about AI safety. LeCun said, founders such as
Altman and Hassabis have spent a lot of time drumming up fear about the
very technology they're selling.
