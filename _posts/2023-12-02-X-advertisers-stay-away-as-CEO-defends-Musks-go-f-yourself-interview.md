> X CEO Linda Yaccarino called owner Elon Musk "Candid and profound" in a
memo to staff addressing the public interview in which Musk told
advertisers to "Go f*** yourself." Yaccarino's full memo to staff
addressing Musk's interview was published by CNBC. "Our mission at X is
bold: to be an open platform without censorship of thought-one that
provides people information and the freedom to make up their own minds,"
she wrote. Yaccarino also defended Musk publicly in a post on twitter.com,
writing that the X owner "Offered an apology, an explanation and an
explicit point of view about our position. X is enabling an information
independence that's uncomfortable for some people. We're a platform that
allows people to make their own decisions."
