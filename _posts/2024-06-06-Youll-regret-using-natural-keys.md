> In order to teach database keys, it starts with natural keys.  Finally,
even if you've found a natural key that is guaranteed to be unique and
track the actual entity that you want to keep track of, there's a final
argument against using an externally defined key in your system: Data-entry
errors. I agree that using natural keys as physical primary keys is a bad
idea but you really should be modelling your data logically with natural
keys.
