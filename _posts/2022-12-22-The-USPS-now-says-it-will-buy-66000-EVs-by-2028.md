>On Tuesday, the long-running saga of the United States Postal Service's delivery fleet took another turn when Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced that the service is increasing the number of electric vehicles it plans to purchase. The new plan calls for a minimum of 60,000 Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDV) by 2028, 45,000 of which will be battery EVs. The USPS will also buy an additional 21,000 commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) EVs--perhaps EVs like the Ford e-Transit or the BrightDrop Zevo 600--for deliveries by 2028. And from 2026, all vehicles bought by the USPS will be BEVs.

I'm glad they reversed their earlier decision.
