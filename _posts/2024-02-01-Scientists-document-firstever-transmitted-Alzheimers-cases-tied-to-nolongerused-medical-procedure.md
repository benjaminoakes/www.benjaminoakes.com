> They are the first known cases of transmitted Alzheimer's disease, likely
a scientific anomaly yet a finding that adds another wrinkle to ongoing
arguments about what truly causes Alzheimer's. "It raises questions about
whether amyloid alone is able to cause problems," said Marc Dhenain, an
Alzheimer's expert at the French research center CEA, who was not involved
in the new study. The researchers noted that the presentation of iatrogenic
CJD often differs from that of the more common sporadic cases, so it's
possible the transmitted Alzheimer's cases would look somewhat distinct
from typical cases.
