> On Monday, Mistral AI announced a new AI language model called Mixtral
8x7B, a "Mixture of experts" model with open weights that reportedly truly
matches OpenAI's GPT-3.5 in performance-an achievement that has been
claimed by others in the past but is being taken seriously by AI
heavyweights such as OpenAI's Andrej Karpathy and Jim Fan. Most notably,
Mistral's models run locally with open weights that can be downloaded and
used with fewer restrictions than closed AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
or Google. Mistral began offering beta access to an API for three levels of
Mistral models on Monday.
