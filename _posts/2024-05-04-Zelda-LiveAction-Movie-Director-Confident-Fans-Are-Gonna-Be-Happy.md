> Movie director Wes Ball has recently been doing press rounds to promote
his new Planet of the Apes movie and he's once again been asked about his
upcoming live-action Zelda movie. Although he can't say much, during a chat
with The Direct, The Legend of Zelda movie director reassured fans about
his love of the series and how it has been "One of the most important
things ever" in his life. Wes Ball: "We're working on it. I think it's
gonna be great. Fans are gonna be happy. 'Legend of Zelda,' to me, is one
of the most important things ever in my life. You know, next to 'Star
Wars.' I've played 'Legend of Zelda' throughout my childhood into my
adulthood. You know what I mean? I am a fan. I am a fellow fan. I will go
to the ends of the earth to make sure that it is the movie we all hope it
will be."
