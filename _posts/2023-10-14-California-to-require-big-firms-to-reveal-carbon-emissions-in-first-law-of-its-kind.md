>A groundbreaking California law will force large companies doing business in the state - including major global corporations - to disclose their planet-heating carbon emissions.  [...]  SB 253 will require California regulators to create rules by 2025 for public and private companies whose annual revenues exceed $1bn. That affects about 5,300 corporations, including Chevron, Wells Fargo, Amazon and Apple.
