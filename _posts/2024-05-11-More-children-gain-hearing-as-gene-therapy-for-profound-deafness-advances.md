> On Wednesday, Larry Lustig, an otolaryngologist at Columbia University,
presented clinical trial data of two children with profound deafness-the
most severe type of deafness-who are now able to hear at normal levels
after receiving an experimental gene therapy. On Thursday, Yilai Shu, an
otolaryngologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, provided a one-year
progress report on six children who were treated in the first in-human
trial of gene therapy for genetic therapy. Lustig calls it a "Jumping
point." Now that researchers have shown that this gene therapy can work,
"This is going to really spark, we hope, the development of gene therapy
for more common types of deafness," he said.
