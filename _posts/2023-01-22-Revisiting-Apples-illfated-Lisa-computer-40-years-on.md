I used one of these at Seattle's Living Computers Museum.  It's amazing that that was even possible.  They had an Apple I and Xerox Alto as well.  Those few machines and the ideas behind them changed the world in a huge number of ways.

I'm also very happy to see the [Lisa source code](https://info.computerhistory.org/apple-lisa-code) is now available to the public.
