>GM says it expects it will build more than 70,000 Bolt EVs and EUVs this year before production ends for good. The death of the Bolt doesn't mean the death of affordable EVs at GM, however. Among the three EVs it will launch this year is the Equinox EV, which should also start at less than $30,000.

So I guess they are retiring the dedicated EV brands in favor of making EV versions of everything? That might actually be a good change. Some people won't want the "special" cars. Maybe they will want an EV of a brand that they already recognize.

Still, it doesn't look good to have discontinued both the Volt and the Bolt.  And honestly, if they had kept making Volts through the last few years when gas prices went crazy, they would have sold well.  That discontinuation was very short-sighted.  Plug-in hybrids are a great option for a large part of the United States, and GM used to be a leader in this respect. I'm less sure about their strategy now, but I'm also not in the market for a new vehicle.  We'll have to see what happens.
