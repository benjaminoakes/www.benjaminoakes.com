> With price hikes becoming a norm for streaming services, subscribers are
reconsidering the value of streaming apps and whether subscriptions are
worth the cost. The new offer joins two other deals that Verizon already
offers that bundle its wireless service with TV streaming. A Netflix-Max
bundle through Verizon and a potential bundle with Apple TV+ and Paramount+
follow a trend that sees streaming apps partnering with other apps and
other types of companies with subscription-based revenue to ultimately
offer TV streaming at a lower monthly price.

This sounds like it will end up being worse than cable, but DVDs and
Blu-Rays are likely to disappear completely in the next 10-15 years.  This
could be bad for consumers.

That said, they still make DVD copies of the new Star Trek shows on
Paramount+ which are probably at your library.
