>One of the Rails mantras is "convention over configuration," sane defaults that limit the cognitive overhead of application development. It's easy to learn and easy to build with... right up until you want to deploy your app to production. At that point, the hand-holding ends. Like the Roadrunner, Rails stops right before the cliff and lets you, Wile E. Coyote, sail over the edge. We have active record for interacting with databases, active storage for storing files, etc, but where's active deployment? Come learn how Kuby, a new deployment tool, is trying to bridge the gap.

This is an interesting idea.  I hope that the idea of an out-of-the-box way to deploy continues to be a focus for the Rails community.
