businesses.

>Though initiated by Apple, Goldman Sachs has allegedly been interested in
ending its partnership with Apple for a while now. The financial losses
seem like the biggest point of contention between the companies, but the
WSJ also reports that Apple has frustrated Goldman Sachs execs by demanding
that most people who apply for an Apple Card get approved, and that all
Apple Card customers receive their bills on the same day (banks typically
try to spread these bills out to avoid a deluge of customer service calls).
Executives also partly blame Apple for regulatory issues that Goldman has
had with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Reserve.

What strange things to demand.
