> Firefox has never been the most popular browser, but it has majorly
influenced every popular browser and made the web a better place. That's
why I believe that Ladybird, a new browser written completely from scratch,
and the Ladybird Browser Initiative, a nonprofit funded exclusively by
donations whose sole purpose is the development of the Ladybird browser,
can make a difference. I believe in Ladybird and I believe in Andreas'
vision, and I hope you'll help us support an open, independent browser that
supports you.

$1M isn't exactly a huge sum of money for more than 4 developers to live
on.  I hope there's more to come.

I also hope Wanstrath gives money to Mozilla for the same reasons.
