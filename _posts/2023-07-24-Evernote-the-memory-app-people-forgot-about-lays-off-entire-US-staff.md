> Bending Spoons, which acquired Evernote in November 2022, had laid off
129 workers in February 2023, stating that Evernote had been "Unprofitable
for years" and "Unsustainable in the long term." Whatever unspecified
number of remaining employees remain in the US received notice of the move
on June 23, then the layoff on July 5, according to a company blog post.
"Our plans for Evernote are as ambitious as ever: Going forward, a
dedicated team based in Europe will continue to assume ownership of the
Evernote product," wrote Francesco Patarnello, Evernote's CEO. "This team
will be in an ideal position to leverage the extensive expertise and
strength of the 400-plus workforce at Bending Spoons, many of whom have
been working on Evernote full-time since the acquisition." Evernote was
growing internationally, looking toward an IPO, and toying with side
projects like Evernote Hello, Evernote Food, and Evernote Peek.

I always wanted to try this, but never did.  Glad I didn't?
