title: "Google's Android app store monopoly violates antitrust law, jury finds"
date: 2023-12-12
---

> A federal jury took only a few hours of deliberation Monday afternoon to
determine that Google had an illegal monopoly in the markets for Android
app distribution and in-app billing services. Google "Engaged in
anticompetitive conduct" to establish or maintain the monopoly and
illegally tied the Google Play store to the use of Google Play billing,
according to the verdict. Google Government Affairs & Public Policy VP
Wilson White said in a statement provided to the press that the company
would challenge the verdict and that Android and Google Play "Provide more
choice and openness than any other major mobile platform. The trial made
clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app
stores on Android devices and gaming consoles. We will continue to defend
the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users,
partners, and the broader Android ecosystem."

I suspect Apple will be challenged again based on this.

Another reminder to prefer the open web.
