> Though the vast majority of people use the Standard view on their PCs
without question, the HTML version of Gmail has its perks. The
stripped-down Gmail experience loads quickly, and users can access it even
on very outdated machines or with much slower connections. Its leaner
nature makes it useful in situations where the best you can muster is a 3G
connection (3G died last year in the US, but still).

As it should happen, I randomly decided to use HTML Gmail and this article
is that I found in my RSS to email service. Ironic!

Modern Gmail has gotten very slow and I hope they focus on instant
loading.  It takes a very long time to open a `mailto` link, for example.
