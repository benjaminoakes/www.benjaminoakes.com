> Actors study the script, trying to understand their character and seeing
how their lines relate to that character. When psychologists Helga and Tony
Noice surveyed actors on how they learn their lines, they found that actors
search for meaning in the script, rather than memorizing lines. In
describing how they remember their lines, actors are telling us an
important truth about memory - deep understanding promotes long-lasting
memories.
