> Since Monday, Carrefour has been putting stickers on products that have
shrunk in size but cost more even after raw materials prices have eased, to
rally consumer support as retailers prepare to face the world's biggest
brands in negotiations due to start soon and end by 15 October. Carrefour
has marked 26 products in its stores in France with the labels, which say:
"This product has seen its volume or weight fall and the effective price
from the supplier rise." The shrinkflation warnings are in all French
Carrefour stores, and will last until the targeted suppliers agree to price
cuts, Bompais said.
