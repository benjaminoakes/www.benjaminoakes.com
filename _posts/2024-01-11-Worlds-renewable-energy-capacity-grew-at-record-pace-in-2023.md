Summary:

In 2023, global renewable energy capacity surged by 50% to 510 GW, marking the fastest growth in two decades, as reported by the International Energy Agency. Solar power, predominantly from China, represented three-quarters of this increase. The IEA predicts renewables could surpass coal in electricity generation by 2025 and cover over 42% by 2028. This progress aligns with climate targets set at the Cop28, aiming to triple renewable capacity by 2030 to reduce fossil fuel use.
