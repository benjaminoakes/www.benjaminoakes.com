> One of the remarkable characteristics of the Super Nintendo was the
ability for game cartridges to pack more than instructions and assets into
ROM chips. Super Mario RPG PCB. Above, a Mario RPG PCB. Notice the absence
of CIC chip, a ROM chip in U1 containing the game instructions and assets,
a SRAM chip in U2, and the SA-1 in U3. Notice there is no oscillator since
the SA-1 uses the System Master clock line from the cart port and halves it
internally. The SA-1 CPU and the Super NES CPU operate simultaneously,
which results in five times greater performance of the Super Accelerator
System over the current Super NES. - Super Nintendo Developer Manual Book
II. Thanks to the improved processing, the SNES is able to animate and
detect collisions on all 128 sprites available in the PPU. The horsepower
also allowed to transform sprites on the fly and write them back into the
PPU VRAM. The dramatic improvements were demonstrated in a Nintendo SA-1
demo cart.
