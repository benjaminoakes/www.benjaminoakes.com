> 1. Understand and accept that you will make mistakes
> 2. You are not your code
> 3. No matter how much "karate" you know, someone else will always know more
> 4. Dont rewrite code without consultation
> 5. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience
> 6. The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile
> 7. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position
> 8. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat
> 9. Dont be "the coder in the corner."
> 10. Critique code instead of people -- be kind to the coder, not to the code
