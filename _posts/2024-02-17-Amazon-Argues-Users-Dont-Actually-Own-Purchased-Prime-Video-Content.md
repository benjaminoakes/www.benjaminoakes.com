> On Monday, Amazon filed a motion to dismiss her complaint arguing that
she lacks standing to sue because she hasn't been injured - and noting that
she's purchased 13 titles on Prime since filing her complaint. "Plaintiff
claims that Defendant Amazon's Prime Video service, which allows consumers
to purchase video content for streaming or download, misleads consumers
because sometimes that video content might later become unavailable if a
third-party rights' holder revokes or modifies Amazon's license," writes
attorney David Biderman in the motion, which is posted below. "The
Complaint points vaguely to online commentary about this alleged potential
harm but does not identify any Prime Video purchase unavailable to
Plaintiff herself. In fact, all of the Prime Video content that Plaintiff
has ever purchased remains available."

When will this be made clearer to consumers?
