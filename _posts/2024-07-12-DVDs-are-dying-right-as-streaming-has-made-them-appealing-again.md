> The end of Redbox marks another death knell for the DVD industry at a
time when volatile streaming services are making physical media appealing
again. In August, Netflix quit its original business of mailing out rental
DVDs. Now the king of streaming, the remaining DVD business was so menial
that Netflix gave away DVDs as it shut down operations. With the streaming
industry becoming more competitive and profit-hungry than ever, you never
know if the movie/show that most attracted you to a streaming service will
still be available when you finally get a chance to sit down and watch.

It's good to have an alternative to streaming.

I, for one, appreciate being able to check out DVDs from the library.
