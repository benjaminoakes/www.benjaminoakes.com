>As Earth reaches record temperatures, scientists propose a space sunshade to counter global warming. Blocking 2% of the sun's radiation could cool the planet by 1.5 C. Interest in sun shields is growing, with variations like scattering dust or creating "space bubbles." Researchers are exploring innovative solutions, such as tethering a solar shield to a repurposed asteroid.
