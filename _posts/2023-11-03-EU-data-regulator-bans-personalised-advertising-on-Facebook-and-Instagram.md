> The European data regulator has agreed to expand Norway's ban on
'behavioural advertising' on Facebook and Instagram to cover all 30
countries in the European Union and the European Economic Area. The
European Data Protection Board has instructed the Irish data regulator,
where Meta's European headquarters are located, to impose a permanent ban
on Meta's use of behavioural advertising within two weeks. The ban on
behavioural advertising will impact approximately 250 million Facebook and
Instagram users in Europe, as indicated by the Norwegian data regulator.
