> The appendix has a high concentration of immune tissue, so it's acting to
help the immune system fight any bad things in the gut. During times of
gastrointestinal distress - you know, a diarrhea episode where all of your
good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the system - the
appendix is kind of this blind tube with a very narrow diameter and narrow
lumen, so the good bacteria doesn't get flushed out of the appendix. People
are looking into antibiotics and other ways of treating appendicitis
without completely removing it, given the evidence that is accumulating
that it is in fact helpful for your health to have an appendix.
