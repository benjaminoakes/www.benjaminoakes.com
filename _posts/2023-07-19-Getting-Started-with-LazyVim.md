I haven't changed my plain old Vim config much in a long time.  Neovim is
really interesting and I'm curious about it, but... if it ain't broke,
don't fix it?  I definitely think there's some room to improve what I have
though.  If I do switch, it may be best to just jump in with a preset
config and reap the benefits of delegation.
