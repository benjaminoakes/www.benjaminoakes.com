> Later, Mike Swoopskee tweeted, "What if it learned from its training data
that people usually slow down in December and put bigger projects off until
the new year, and that's why it's been more lazy lately?". Since the system
prompt for ChatGPT feeds the bot the current date, people noted, some began
to think there may be something to the idea. One of the reports that
started the recent trend of noting that ChatGPT is getting "Lazy" came on
November 24 via Reddit, the day after Thanksgiving in the US. There, a user
wrote that they asked ChatGPT to fill out a CSV file with multiple entries,
but ChatGPT refused, saying, "Due to the extensive nature of the data, the
full extraction of all products would be quite lengthy. However, I can
provide the file with this single entry as a template, and you can fill in
the rest of the data as needed."
