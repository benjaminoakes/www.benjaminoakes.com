> Zoom CEO Eric Yuan has a vision for the future of work: sending your
AI-powered digital twin to attend meetings on your behalf. In an interview
with The Verge's Nilay Patel published Monday, Yuan shared his plans for
Zoom to become an "AI-first company," using AI to automate tasks and reduce
the need for human involvement in day-to-day work. LLMs are large language
models-text-predicting AI models that power AI assistants like ChatGPT and
Microsoft Copilot.

This is a very questionable idea.

Also:

> "I'm not a fan of that idea where people build LLM systems that attempt
to simulate individuals," wrote AI researcher Simon Willison recently on X,
independently of the news from Yuan. "The idea that an LLM can usefully
predict a response from an individual seems so obviously wrong to me. It's
equivalent to getting business advice from a talented impersonator/improv
artist: Just because they can 'sound like' someone doesn't mean they can
provide genuinely useful insight."

Exactly.
