title: "Google's AI Overview is flawed by design, and a new company blog post hints at why"

> On Thursday, Google capped off a rough week of providing inaccurate and
sometimes dangerous answers through its experimental AI Overview feature by
authoring a follow-up blog post titled, "AI Overviews: About last week." In
the post, attributed to Google VP Liz Reid, head of Google Search, the firm
formally acknowledged issues with the feature and outlined steps taken to
improve a system that appears flawed by design, even if it doesn't realize
it is admitting it. To recap, the AI Overview feature-which the company
showed off at Google I/O a few weeks ago-aims to provide search users with
summarized answers to questions by using an AI model integrated with
Google's web ranking systems. Generally ignoring the folly of basing its AI
results on a broken page-ranking algorithm, Google's blog post instead
attributes the commonly circulated errors to several other factors,
including users making nonsensical searches "Aimed at producing erroneous
results." Google does admit faults with the AI model, like misinterpreting
queries, misinterpreting "a nuance of language on the web," and lacking
sufficient high-quality information on certain topics.

It sounds like an interesting idea, but it's not trustworthy.
