> The new partnership grants OpenAI access to Reddit's Data API, giving the
generative AI firm real-time access to Reddit posts. The deal is similar to
one that Reddit struck with Google in February that allows the tech giant
to make "New ways to display Reddit content" and provide "More efficient
ways to train models," Reddit said at the time. Under the OpenAI
partnership, Reddit also gains access to OpenAI large language models to
create features for Reddit, including its volunteer moderators.
