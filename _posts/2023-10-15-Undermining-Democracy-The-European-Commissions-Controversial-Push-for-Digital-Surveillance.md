> The European Commission wants to turn digital communication apps, such as
WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram, TikTok and X, into mass surveillance tools
so that digital communications of all EU citizens, including their live
conversations, photos and videos, can be automatically scanned for criminal
offences. To sway European public opinion the European Commission went even
further. The European Commission should take the ad campaigns offline and
keep them offline, and refrain from future attempts to bend European public
opinion to its will with manipulative disinformation campaigns through
illegal ads on social media.

This seems antithetical to much of what I see happening in Europe.
