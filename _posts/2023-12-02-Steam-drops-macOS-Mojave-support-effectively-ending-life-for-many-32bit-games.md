> Valve Software's Steam gaming marketplace and app will drop support for
macOS 10.13 and 10.14, according to a support page post. Steam Support will
be unable to offer users technical support for issues related to the old
operating systems, and Steam will be unable to guarantee continued
functionality of Steam on the unsupported operating system versions.
Advertisement "The Steam store will stop considering games that offer only
32-bit macOS binaries to be Mac compatible at the end of 2023," Valve
writes.

Gaming on Apple platforms is much different than Linux and Windows.

Also:

> All told, playing historical games on the Mac is a complicated affair due
to waves of deprecation. PowerPC gave way to Intel, Intel Macs moved from
32-bit to 64-bit, and most recently, Apple moved the Mac from Intel to
Apple Silicon with the M1 chip and its successors.

This is good for Apple, but creates a lot of eWaste. So many working yet
practically unusable computers.
