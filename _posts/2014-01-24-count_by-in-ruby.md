This is just a simple addition to Ruby&#8217;s `Enumerable` that both [Dan Bernier](http://invisibleblocks.com/) and I agreed should be a part of Ruby&#8217;s standard library.

```ruby
# count_by.rb
# License: MIT
#
# Authors: Benjamin Oakes, Dan Bernier

module Enumerable
  def count_by(&block)
    group_by(&block).map { |criteria, group| [criteria, group.count] }
  end
end

require 'minitest/spec'
require 'minitest/autorun'

describe 'count_by' do
  it 'counts the groups' do
    counts = %w(a b b c d d e e e e).count_by { |s| s }
    assert_equal(counts, [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 1], ["d", 2], ["e", 4]])
  end
end
```

**Update (2019-02-19):** [This is likely to be added to Ruby 2.7 as `tally`](https://www.benjaminoakes.com/ruby/2019/02/19/Ruby-27-adds-Enumerabletally/).
