> Let's start with the extortion regime that'll befell any large developer
who might be tempted to try hosting their app in one of these new
alternative app stores that the EU forced Apple to allow. Let's just say
for easy math there's 250 million of those in the EU. In order to
distribute Instagram on, say, a new Microsoft iOS App Store, Meta would
have to pay Apple $11,277,174 PER MONTH(!!!) as a "Core Technology Fee".
You add a hundred million here and a hundred million there, and suddenly
you're talking about real money! Even for a big corporation like Meta, it
would be an insane expense to offer all their apps in these new alternative
app stores.
