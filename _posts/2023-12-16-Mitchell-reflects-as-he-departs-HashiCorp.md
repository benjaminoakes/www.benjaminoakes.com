> My departure from HashiCorp is something I've been thinking about and
planning for a long time. Ever since founding HashiCorp, I've felt it's
important to build a company where I'm not required for day-to-day
operations and where other leaders can carry the torch over time. I have
been very intentional about this as time went on: stepping down from being
CEO in 2016, iterating over time on a culture of leadership autonomy that
didn't require my involvement to make decisions, and finally departing the
leadership team and board of directors in 2021. Since then, I've had the
pleasure of working where I'm happiest -- as a full-time, hands-on engineer.

Something to respect in this decision.
