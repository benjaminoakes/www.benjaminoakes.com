Awesome.

Bare minimum, all new buildings in the US should use good solar-aware design. It's cheap to orient windows towards the south for passive solar heating, for example. All roofs should be able to have solar panels easily added later too. Too many new houses are built simply facing the wrong direction. (That's not the type of thing you can really fix later.)
