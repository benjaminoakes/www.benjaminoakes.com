> It's been almost four years since third-party cookies have been disabled
in Firefox and Safari, but Google, one of the world's largest ad companies,
has been slow-rolling the death of the tracking cookie. The rollout comes
with some new UI bits for Chrome, with Google saying, "If a site doesn't
work without third-party cookies and Chrome notices you're having
issues-like if you refresh a page multiple times-we'll prompt you with an
option to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for that website from
the eye icon on the right side of your address bar." Since other browsers
have been doing this for four years, it's hard to imagine many web admins
not being ready for it. Google says its choice to offer this privacy
feature four years after its competitors is a "Responsible approach" to
phasing out third-party cookies.
