title: "Google Drive users say Google lost their files; Google is investigating"

> On Monday The Register spotted a trending post on the Google Drive forums
where a user claimed that months of Drive data suddenly disappeared, and
their files went back to a state from May 2023. It's hard to imagine losing
files in this mode, since at the end of the day they are still files on
your hard drive. That's all to say that, if Google lost data, and you were
in File Stream mode, there's a good chance you don't actually have your
files anymore.

This is terrifying. You should do a Google Takeout today, just to have a
copy of your data before it's too late.
