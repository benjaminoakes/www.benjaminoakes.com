> I've set up dozens of smart home gadgets across two homes and two
apartments over the last five years. Together, they would offer a home
that, while well-connected, could also work entirely inside a home network
and switch between controlling ecosystems with ease. Hue bulbs were, for me
and many others, a first step into home automation.

I am currently regretting using Google Home because, slowly but surely,
it's losing Google's attention and breaking down.  It was much nicer just a
few years ago.

Maybe Zigbee and Z-Wave are the way forward.
