>This means Mozilla will no longer be advocating for an open web, privacy, and related ideals, which fits right in with the organisation's steady decline into an ad-driven effort that also happens to be making a web browser used by, I'm sorry to say, effectively nobody. I just don't know how many more signs people need to see before realising that the future of Firefox is very much at stake, and that we're probably only a few years away from losing the only non-big tech browser out there. This should be a much bigger concern than it seems to be to especially the Linux and BSD world, who rely heavily on Firefox, without a valid alternative to shift to once the browser's no longer compatible with the various open source requirements enforced by Linux distributions and the BSDs.

This is bad news for everyone, regardless of what technology you use in your life. 

I just hope someone at Mozilla is smart enough to have a Chromium-based browser being made in secret, just in case. We need the Mozilla ethos more than we need the Gecko and Servo rendering engines.

Google, Microsoft, and Apple don't have our best interests at heart. Mozilla does. Simple as that.
