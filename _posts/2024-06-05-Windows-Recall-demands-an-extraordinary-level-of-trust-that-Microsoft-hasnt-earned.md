> Copilot+ PCs are required to have a fast neural processing unit so that
processing can be performed locally rather than sending data to the cloud;
local snapshots are protected at rest by Windows' disk encryption
technologies, which are generally on by default if you've signed into a
Microsoft account; neither Microsoft nor other users on the PC are supposed
to be able to access any particular user's Recall snapshots; and users can
choose to exclude apps or individual websites to exclude from Recall's
snapshots. We've also given this early version of Recall a try on a Windows
Dev Kit 2023, which we've used for all our recent Windows-on-Arm testing,
and we've independently verified Beaumont's claims about how easy it is to
find and view raw Recall data once you have access to a user's PC.

Albacore has published a tool called AmperageKit that will enable it on
Arm-based Windows PCs running Windows 11 24H2 build 26100.
