title: "Why The New York Times might win its copyright lawsuit against OpenAI"

> The day after The New York Times sued OpenAI for copyright infringement,
the author and systems architect Daniel Jeffries wrote an essay-length
tweet arguing that the Times "Has a near zero probability of winning" its
lawsuit. "Copyright law is about preventing people from producing exact
copies or near exact copies of content and posting it for commercial gain.
Period. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying or simply does not
understand how copyright works." We expect OpenAI to argue that the Google
ruling allows OpenAI to use copyrighted documents to train its generative
models.
