> There are a lot of small websites on the Internet: Interesting websites,
beautiful websites, unique websites. Unfortunately they are incredibly hard
to find. You cannot find them on Google or Reddit, and while you can
stumble onto them with my search engine, it is not in a very directed
fashion. It is an unfortunate state of affairs. Even if you do not
particularly care for becoming the next big thing, its still discouraging
to put work into a website and get next to no traffic beyond the usual bots.
