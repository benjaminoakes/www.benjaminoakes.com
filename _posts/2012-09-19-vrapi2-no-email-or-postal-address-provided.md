I ran into an error with the VerticalResponse API today, and to my surprise there were no results when searching on Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo. Not even in the [VerticalResponse documentation](http://developers.verticalresponse.com/)!

![Your search - VRAPI2.NO_EMAIL_OR_POSTAL_ADDRESS_PROVIDED - did not match any documents.](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-shot-2012-09-19-at-10.31.20-AM.png)

The error was:

```
A general API error occurred: "VRAPI2.NO_EMAIL_OR_POSTAL_ADDRESS_PROVIDED" - "no email or postal address was provided, but at least one is required"
```

I tracked it down to a call to [`editListMember`](http://developers.verticalresponse.com/api/soap/methods/lists/editlistmember/), which I guessed didn&#8217;t include the `email_address` in `member_data`. After adding it, the error message has gone away.

At any rate, there will now be a result if someone else searches for the error message. :)</p>
