>James Lambert has spent years making something with no practical reason to exist: a version of Portal that runs on the Nintendo 64. And not some 2D version, either, but the real, blue-and-orange-oval, see-yourself-sideways Portal experience. And now he has a "First Slice" of Portal 64 ready for anyone who wants to try it. It's out of beta, and it's free.
