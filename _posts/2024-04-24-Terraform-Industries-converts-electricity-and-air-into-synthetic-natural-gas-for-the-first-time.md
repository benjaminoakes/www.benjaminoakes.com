Summary:

Terraform Industries has created a machine called the Terraformer that makes synthetic natural gas from electricity and air. It's as big as two shipping containers and uses solar power to turn hydrogen and captured CO2 into gas. The startup claims it can make hydrogen for under $2.50 per kilogram and capture CO2 for less than $250 per ton, aiming to match the cost of natural gas. They've made gas that meets utility standards and are planning to scale up production.
