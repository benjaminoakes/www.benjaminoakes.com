>But here's the problem. TextMate is tied to the Mac. And tying myself to the Mac seems like an increasingly bad idea. Apple has turned into the kind of company that I just don't want to have to rely on. That doesn't mean I can't use any of their products, but I absolutely do not want to feel like I have to. I want to have the independence where walking away is always an option, and it just isn't, as long as I'm committed to TextMate.

DHH is definitely beginning to understand.  ([Previously](https://www.benjaminoakes.com/2024/02/26/Switching-to-Android-was-easy/).)

I went through a similar thought process about 10 years ago, when I first started seeing where Apple was headed.  They certainly make nice hardware and software.  DHH has articulated the counterargument well, and this could be the start of something larger, given his influence in the industry.
