>Ford CEO Jim Farley took to a Twitter Space on Thursday afternoon with some pretty big news. Ford and Tesla have agreed to give Ford EVs access to Tesla's Supercharger network. Ford, like most of the industry, uses the CCS plug for fast charging, but Tesla has a proprietary port and cable, one that's noticeably smaller and lighter than the cumbersome CCS plug. Current Ford EVs will require an adapter to connect what Tesla is now calling the "North American Charging Standard" (NACS) cable to its Combined Charging System (CCS) ports. But Ford's next series of EVs will feature native NACS ports, removing the need for an adapter.
