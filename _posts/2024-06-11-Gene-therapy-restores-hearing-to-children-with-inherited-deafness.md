> The first clinical trial to administer gene therapy to both ears in one
person has restored hearing function to 5 children born with a form of
inherited deafness, astounding the research team. "The results from these
studies are astounding," says study co-senior author Zheng-Yi Chen, an
associate scientist in the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Massachusetts Eye
and Ear in the US. "We continue to see the hearing ability of treated
children dramatically progress and the new study shows added benefits of
the gene therapy when administrated to both ears, including the ability for
sound source localisation and improvements in speech recognition in noisy
environments." "Lead author Yilai Shu, an attending doctor in
otolaryngology and an investigator at Eye and Ear, Nose, Throat hospital of
Fudan University, China, says:"restoring hearing in both ears of children
who are born deaf can maximise the benefits of hearing recovery.
