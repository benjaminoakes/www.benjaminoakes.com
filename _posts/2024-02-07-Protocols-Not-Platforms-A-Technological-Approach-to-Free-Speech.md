> There is reason to believe that moving to a system of protocols could
solve many of the problems associated with platforms today and that it
could be done while minimizing the problems that were inherent to protocols
a few decades ago. Third, the existing platforms may explore the use of
protocols as an effective way of competing against other large internet
platforms in areas where they have much less ability to compete. Moving us
back toward a world where protocols are dominant over platforms could be of
tremendous benefit to free speech and innovation online.
