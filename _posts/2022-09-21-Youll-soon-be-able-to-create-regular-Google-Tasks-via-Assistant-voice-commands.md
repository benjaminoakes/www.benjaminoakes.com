>Millions of people use Google to help them stay on top of their everyday to-dos across Google Assistant, Calendar and Tasks.  Soon, well be simplifying our task management solutions by migrating  Assistant and Calendar Reminders to Google Tasks. This means you will now have an easy way to view and manage all your to-dos in one place through Google Tasks, regardless of whether you create them using Assistant or Calendar.

This is a mess that I will be happy to see go away by using Google Tasks.
