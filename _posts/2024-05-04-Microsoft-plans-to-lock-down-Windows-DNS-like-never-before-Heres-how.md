> Admins are left to choose between equally unappealing options: route DNS
traffic in clear text with no means for the server and client device to
authenticate each other so malicious domains can be blocked and network
monitoring is possible, or encrypt and authenticate DNS traffic and do away
with the domain control and network visibility. ZTDNS aims to solve this
decades-old problem by integrating the Windows DNS engine with the Windows
Filtering Platform-the core component of the Windows Firewall-directly into
client devices. The result, he said, is a mechanism that allows
organizations to, in essence, tell clients "Only use our DNS server, that
uses TLS, and will only resolve certain domains." Microsoft calls this DNS
server or servers the "Protective DNS server."
