> The report detailed how the user managed to leak DNS queries when
disabling and enabling VPN while having "Block connections without VPN" on.
The leak during tunnel reconnects is harder for us to mitigate in our app.
Apps may still leak DNS traffic during the conditions mentioned above, and
as previously reported it still leaks connection check traffic.

Ugh

Also, Mullvad is behind the Mozilla VPN
