>Genetic profiling service 23andMe has confirmed that private user data is circulating for sale online after being scraped off its website.  [...] 23andMe officials on Friday confirmed that private data for some of its users is up for sale.  [...]  The data included profile and account ID numbers, names, gender, birth year, maternal and paternal genetic markers, ancestral heritage results, and data on whether or not each user has opted into 23andme's health data.
