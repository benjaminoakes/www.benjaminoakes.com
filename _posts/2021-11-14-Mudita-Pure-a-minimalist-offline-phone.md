I've been trying to use my smartphone less, so this is really interesting.  Unfortunately, what seems to be a dependence on a sync cable makes this a step too far,  maybe.  That and the steep price tag for such a simple device ($369?) is a little offputting too.

So, I guess what's missing is:

- Maps?
- Music that I don't have to sync and manage myself?
- Task management?

It's still very, very interesting though.
