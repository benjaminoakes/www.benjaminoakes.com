> Vanced used a WebView and tricked YouTube into playing ad-free videos and
unlocked YouTube Premium features like background playback. Because Vanced
was just an app, it didn't require root and wasn't stopped by the Play
Integrity API. Allowing YouTube to reach into your phone via the WebView
sounds like something that could shut down these "alternative" clients,
though. Google has become increasingly hostile toward ad blockers in recent
years, and while the Google legal department already killed YouTube Vanced
with a cease-and-desist letter in 2022, having the technical department put
a stake through the heart of modified clients sounds like the next
plausible step.

This is a concerning precedent.  It's a good time to consider using Firefox.
