> Researchers at Mass Eye and Ear have linked tinnitus, a condition
affecting over 10% of adults worldwide, to undetectable auditory nerve
loss. A groundbreaking study by Mass Eye and Ear associates tinnitus with
undetected auditory nerve damage, challenging previous beliefs and opening
new paths for treatment through auditory nerve regeneration. By measuring
the response of their auditory nerve and brainstem, the researchers found
that chronic tinnitus was not only associated with a loss of auditory nerve
but that participants showed hyperactivity in the brainstem.
