> Defaulting to "web" search will let you use Google with only the 10 blue
links, and while that feels like rolling the interface back to 2011, keep
in mind you're still not rolling back Google's search results quality to
2011. You're still going to be using a search engine that feels like it has
completely surrendered to SEO spammers. So, while this Band-Aid solution is
interesting, things are getting so bad that the real recommendation is
probably to switch to something other than Google at this point. We all
need to find another search engine that values the web and tries to search
it. As opposed to Google, which increasingly seems like it's trying to
sacrifice the web at the altar of AI.
