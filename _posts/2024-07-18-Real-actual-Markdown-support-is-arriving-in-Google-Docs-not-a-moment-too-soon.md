> The best time to truly implement the Markdown markup language into Google
Docs was in the early 2010s, but yesterday was a pretty good time, too. You
could write in Markdown in Docs, but you could not paste, nor could you
import or export between Docs and Markdown styling. Docs can convert
Markdown text to its equivalent Docs formatting on paste or when imported
as a file, and it can export to Markdown from the copy menu or as a file.

Good! Google docs is great for prose, but the simplicity is markdown is
great too
