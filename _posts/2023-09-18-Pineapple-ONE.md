> Pineapple ONE is a functioning processor, that is based on an open-source
architecture RISC-V. This architecture is becoming very popular these days,
and it is well, open-source, so we chose to build a cpu only out of
discrete, off-the-shelf components. Our goal is to prove that designing a
"Modern" CPU isn't that hard, so we have released our schematics and made
it open source as well. Filip Szkandera spent two years designing and
building a 32bit CPU utilising the RISC-V architecture.

A CPU hand-built by a 19-year-old that runs at 500 kHz.  This is really
cool!
