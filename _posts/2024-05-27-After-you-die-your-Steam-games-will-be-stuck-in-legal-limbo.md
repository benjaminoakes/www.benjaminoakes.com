title: "After you die, your Steam games will be stuck in legal limbo"

> Valve has made it clear that no, you cannot will your Steam account or
games to someone else when you die. The issue of digital game
inheritability gained renewed attention this week as a ResetEra poster
quoted a Steam support response asking about transferring Steam account
ownership via a last will and testament. I never even considered merging
Steam accounts, but at least granting access to the person named in your
will or your legal heir seems like something a service like Steam should be
legally obliged to do.
