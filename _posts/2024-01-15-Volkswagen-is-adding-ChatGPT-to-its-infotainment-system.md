> Working with the voice recognition company Cerence, VW is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system. We first experienced Cerence's excellent in-car voice recognition at CES in 2016-back then, it was still part of parent company Nuance, and the system was called Dragon Drive. Nuance spun Cerence off in 2019, and its conversational AI and natural language processing can be enjoyed in current Mercedes and BMW infotainment systems, among others.

Is it ready? Do people really want this when they drive?

I would think reliability would need to be paramount for safety while driving.
