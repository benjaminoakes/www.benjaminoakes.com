> The Internet used to be so simple to use that people collectively coined the term "Let me Google that for you" to make fun of people who had the audacity of asking other people questions online. In the future I fear that people will have no other choice but to ask people for information from the Internet, because right now it's all full of AI dogshit. Yesterday, an unhinged maniac on Twitter claimed to have performed an Internet traffic "Heist." How did he do this? He looked at the site index for the website he wanted to beat in Google search results, exported the article URLS, and then used AI to quickly write articles based on them.
