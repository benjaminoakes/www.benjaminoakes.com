>"The great crises of our time require all of us to do more," Gates said in a foundation press release announcing his decision. "This is why I am raising my giving to the Gates Foundation, helping to increase payout to $9 billion every year. I hope by giving more, we can mitigate some of the suffering people are facing right now and help fulfill the foundation's vision to give every person the chance to live a healthy and productive life."
