title: "George Carlins heirs sue comedy podcast over \"AI-generated\" impression"

> The estate of George Carlin has filed a federal lawsuit against the
comedy podcast Dudesy for an hour-long comedy special sold as an
AI-generated impression of the late comedian. The Dudesy special is
presented as an "Impression" of Carlin that the AI generated by "Listening"
to Carlin's existing material "In the exact same way a human impressionist
would." But the lawsuit takes direct issue with this analogy, arguing that
an AI model is just an "Output generated by a technological process that is
an unlawful appropriation of Carlin's identity, which also damages the
value of Carlin's real work and his legacy." "Defendants always presented
the Dudesy Special as an AI-generated George Carlin comedy special, where
George Carlin was 'resurrected' with the use of modern technology," the
lawsuit argues.

This was obviously going to happen and will be taught in law schools as
what not to do.
