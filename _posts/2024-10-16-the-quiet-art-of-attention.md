>But how does one begin? It is not with grand declarations or bold, sweeping changes. That would miss the point entirely. Rather, it is with a gentle attention to the present, a deliberate shift in the way we move through the world.

And the first step is simply to watch, to observe how the mind moves, without judgment, without rush.
