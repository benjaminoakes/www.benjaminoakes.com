> According to judge Araceli Martnez-Olgun, authors behind three separate
lawsuits-including Sarah Silverman, Michael Chabon, and Paul Tremblay-have
failed to provide evidence supporting any of their claims except for direct
copyright infringement. Among copyright claims tossed by Martnez-Olgun
were accusations of vicarious copyright infringement. As authors likely
prepare to continue fighting OpenAI, the US Copyright Office has been
fielding public input before releasing guidance that could one day help
rights holders pursue legal claims and may eventually require works to be
licensed from copyright owners for use as training materials.
