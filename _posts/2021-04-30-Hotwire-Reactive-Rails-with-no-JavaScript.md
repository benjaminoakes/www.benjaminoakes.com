> The whole frontend evolution has passed me over like a giant wave: I still dont understand why we need to stuff every web app with reacts and webpacks. The classic HTML-first Rails way was my way (or the highway ). Remember the days when JavaScript in your application did not require its own MVC (or MVVM) to function? I miss those days. And these days are quietly making a hell of a comeback.
