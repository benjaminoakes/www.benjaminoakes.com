> Android application for running Windows applications with Wine and Box86/Box64

Basically, it's targeting Windows games.  That's good because Android games, in general, have declined in quality significantly over the last 10 years.

It's amazing that this app works at all, though I'm not sure if it's a great option.  In any case, I hope it does well and is competitive with the Steam Deck.
