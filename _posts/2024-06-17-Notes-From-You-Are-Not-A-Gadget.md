> It's early in the 21st century, and that means that these words will
mostly be read by nonpersons...[they] will be minced...within industrial
cloud computing facilities...They will be scanned, rehashed, and
misrepresented...Ultimately these words will contribute to the fortunes of
those few who have been able to position themselves as lords of the
computing clouds. We care more for the abstractions we can create on top of
individual expression rather than the individuals and their expressions. In
