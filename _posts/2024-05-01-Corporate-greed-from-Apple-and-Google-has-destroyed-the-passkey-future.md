title: "Corporate greed from Apple and Google has destroyed the passkey future"

> William Brown, developer of webauthn-rs, has written a scathing blog post
detailing how corporate interests - namely, Apple and Google - have
completely and utterly destroyed the concept of passkeys. The basic gist is
that Apple and Google were more interested in control and locking in users
than in providing a user-friendly passwordless future, and in doing so have
made passkeys effectively a worse user experience than just using passwords
in a password manager. The whole post is a sobering read of how a dream of
passwordless, and even usernameless, authentication was right within our
grasp, usable by everyone, until Apple and Google got involved and
enshittified the standards and tools to promote lock-in and their own
interests above the user experience.
