title: "UI Density"

> If you're a designer, I'd like you to question the density of the
interfaces you're creating; if you're not a designer, use the lens of UI
density to understand the software you use. If the tradeoffs in visual and
temporal density make the outcome more valuable - either by increasing
submission rate or making the effort more worth the user's time - then
we've increased the overall value density. Finally, a concrete definition
of UI density: UI density is the value a user gets from the interface
divided by the time and space the interface occupies.
