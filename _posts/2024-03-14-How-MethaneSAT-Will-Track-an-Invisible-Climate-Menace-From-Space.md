Summary:

MethaneSAT, a new satellite, is set to launch on a SpaceX rocket to monitor methane emissions globally. Developed by the Environmental Defense Fund, it will use a high-resolution infrared sensor and spectrometer to detect methane from oil and gas sites. MethaneSAT aims to cover 80-90% of global oil and gas production, enhancing leak detection and accountability. The satellite's data will be public.

Also, a reminder that there are other sources of methane.  Please consider reducing your consumption of animal products.
