> On November 22, a few days after OpenAI fired CEO Sam Altman, The
Information reported that OpenAI had made a technical breakthrough that
would allow it to "Develop far more powerful artificial intelligence
models." Dubbed Q* the new model was "Able to solve math problems that it
hadn't seen before." Reuters reported that several OpenAI staffers sent the
board a letter "Warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery
that they said could threaten humanity." However, "Reuters was unable to
review a copy of the letter," and subsequent reporting hasn't connected
Altman's firing to concerns over Q*. The Information reported that earlier
this year, OpenAI built "Systems that could solve basic math problems, a
difficult task for existing AI models." Reuters described Q* as "Performing
math on the level of grade-school students." In a famous January 2022
paper, Google researchers pointed out that large language models produce
better results if they are prompted to reason one step at a time.
