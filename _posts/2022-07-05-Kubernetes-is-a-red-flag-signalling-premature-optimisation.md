> If you are in a place where you think you need Kubernetes, then you are probably in a place where you are trying to optimise for the future prematurely. A future that probably won't happen. If you adopt any technology, you are making a multi-year commitment for your organisation that will increase the surface area of your product and the cognitive load on your developers. Eventually, you will have to create a dedicated team to maintain it. All of this takes resources away from your core mission.
