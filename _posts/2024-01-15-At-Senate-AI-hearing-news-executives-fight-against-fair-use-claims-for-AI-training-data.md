> On Wednesday, news industry executives urged Congress for legal clarification that using journalism to train AI assistants like ChatGPT is not fair use, as claimed by companies such as OpenAI. Instead, they would prefer a licensing regime for AI training content that would force Big Tech companies to pay for content in a method similar to rights clearinghouses for music. Currently, OpenAI is negotiating licensing content from some news providers and striking deals, but the executives in the hearing said those efforts are not enough, highlighting closing newsrooms across the US and dropping media revenues while Big Tech's profits soar. "Journalism is fundamentally a human pursuit, and it plays an essential and irreplaceable role in our society and our democracy." Lynch said that generative AI has been built with "Stolen goods," referring to the use of AI training content from news outlets without authorization.
