> Other people can suggest specific changes to your pull request. You can apply these suggested changes directly in a pull request if you have write access to the repository.

Source: [Incorporating feedback in your pull request - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request#applying-a-suggested-change)

Also available in batches.  This is used in combination with [suggestion blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request).

I've had a couple of discussions with other devs and realized not everyone is aware of this feature.  It can be really handy!  Hope it helps.
