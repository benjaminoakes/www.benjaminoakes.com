> There comes a time in every frontend engineer's life where we realize we
need to cache data from an API. It might start off benign - storing a
previous page of data for that instant back button experience, implementing
a bit of undo logic, or merging some state from different API requests. But
we all know what ends up happening. More feature requests show up, and soon
we're busy implementing data caches, manual indexes, optimistic mutations,
and recursive cache invalidation.

At some point, it's worth stepping back and asking if there are simpler
approaches.
