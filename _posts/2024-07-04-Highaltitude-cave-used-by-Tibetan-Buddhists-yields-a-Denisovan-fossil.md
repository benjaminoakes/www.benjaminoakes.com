title: "High-altitude cave used by Tibetan Buddhists yields a Denisovan fossil"

> On Wednesday, an international group of researchers described finds from
a cave on the Tibetan Plateau that had been occupied by Denisovans, which
tell us a bit more about these relatives: what they ate. Now called the
Xiahe mandible, it remains the most substantial Denisovan fossil we've
discovered to date. Sequencing of environmental DNA preserved in the cave
revealed that the Denisovans had occupied the cave regularly for at least
100,000 years, meaning they were surviving at altitude during both of the
last two glacial cycles.
