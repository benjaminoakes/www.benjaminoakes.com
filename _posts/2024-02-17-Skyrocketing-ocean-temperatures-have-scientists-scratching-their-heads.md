> While we're nowhere near the Atlantic hurricane season yet-that runs from
June 1 through the autumn-keep in mind that cyclones feed on warm ocean
water, which could well stay anomalously hot in the coming months. For the
seas, it really is: Unlike land, which rapidly heats and cools as day turns
to night and back again, it takes a lot to warm up an ocean that may be
thousands of feet deep. If temperatures get too high, certain species might
suffer, shaking the foundations of the ocean food web.

What will get us to change to prevent this?
