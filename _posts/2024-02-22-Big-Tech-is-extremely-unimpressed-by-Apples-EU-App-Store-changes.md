> EU regulators, who are preparing to fine the tech giant 500 million euros
in March over allegedly favoring its music-streaming app against
competitors like Spotify, are also being lobbied to reject Apple's
proposals to satisfy the bloc's Digital Markets Act. The growing backlash
against Apple comes as it is forced to make some of the biggest changes to
its business model in years, following concerns over the dominance of its
App Store, which forms a large share of the company's $85 billion-a-year
services business. For those who choose to also build apps in alternative
stores, Apple said it would cut the highest amount paid by companies using
its App Store to sell digital goods and services from 30 percent to 17
percent.
