> Cryptography theatre: Snake oil cryptography as a legal technology. The
real motive for the popularity of "E2E" amongst tech companies actually
turns out to be fairly obvious: the purpose of adopting snake oil "E2E" is
not to deliver actual security, but to act as a kind of cunning legal
maneuver to exempt themselves from the usual legal obligation to honour
warrants, subpoenas and other court orders. The core of the issue here is
that the web is fundamentally designed around the premise of client-side
code being distributed by the communications service it relates to; that
these two things are coupled together.

Many good points
