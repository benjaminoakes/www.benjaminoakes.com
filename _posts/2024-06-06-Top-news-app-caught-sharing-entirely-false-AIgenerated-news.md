title: "Top news app caught sharing \"entirely false\" AI-generated news"

> After the most downloaded local news app in the US, NewsBreak, shared an
AI-generated story about a fake New Jersey shooting last Christmas Eve, New
Jersey police had to post a statement online to reassure troubled citizens
that the story was "Entirely false," Reuters reported. According to
Reuters, NewsBreak's AI tool, which scrapes the web and helps rewrite local
news stories, has been used to publish at least 40 misleading or erroneous
stories since 2021. Reuters found that not only were NewsBreak's articles
"Not always" error-free, but sometimes the app published local news stories
"Under fictitious bylines." An Ars review suggests that it's likely that
the app is also scraping news stories, perhaps written by AI, that also
seem to use fictitious bylines.
