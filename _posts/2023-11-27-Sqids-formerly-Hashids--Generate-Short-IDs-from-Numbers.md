>Sqids (pronounced "squid") is an open-source library that lets you generate YouTube-looking IDs from numbers. These IDs are short, can be generated from a custom alphabet and are guaranteed to be collision-free.

I've used these before. They're nice for the right use case, but in practice, I've found that people (including me!) get confused about how lookups work. It's much simpler to have a separate short ID field.
