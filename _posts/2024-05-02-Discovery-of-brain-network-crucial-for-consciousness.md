>Summary: Using advanced neuroimaging techniques, researchers identified the "default ascending arousal network" in the human brain, crucial for consciousness. The study mapped connections among the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex, aiding in sustaining wakefulness. Clinical trials are underway to stimulate specific brain areas for coma patients. The research aims to revolutionize treatments for consciousness-related disorders. The study was published in Science Translational Medicine by researchers from Mass General and Boston Childrens Hospital.
