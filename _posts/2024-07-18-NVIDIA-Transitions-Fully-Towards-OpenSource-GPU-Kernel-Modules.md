title: "NVIDIA Transitions Fully Towards Open-Source GPU Kernel Modules"

> With the R515 driver, NVIDIA released a set of Linux GPU kernel modules
in May 2022 as open source with dual GPL and MIT licensing. At the time, we
announced that more robust and fully-featured GeForce and Workstation Linux
support would follow in subsequent releases and the NVIDIA Open Kernel
Modules would eventually supplant the closed-source driver. We're now at a
point where transitioning fully to the open-source GPU kernel modules is
the right move, and we're making that change in the upcoming R560 driver
release.

Finally!  I know a lot of people preferred Radeon over GeForce on Linux.
Competition is good.
