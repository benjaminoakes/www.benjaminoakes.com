>Software organizations that stay in business triage their backlog of bugs like that. They do not drop everything to deal with any damn bug.

Large software packages and organizations will have hundreds if not thousands if not TENS OF THOUSANDS of open bugs of various criticality. THIS IS NORMAL. THIS IS EXPECTED.
