> The good news is that, in May, this is all about to change. Part of the Google update is that all pages with high Page Experience scores are eligible to be in the featured top news carousel. This effectively means that publishers will no longer be forced to use AMP and can instead provide fast, rich experiences on their own domains.

Thank goodness.  Making pages faster (with less JavaScript just to show a simple article) was a laudable goal, but forcing AMP was not a good idea.
