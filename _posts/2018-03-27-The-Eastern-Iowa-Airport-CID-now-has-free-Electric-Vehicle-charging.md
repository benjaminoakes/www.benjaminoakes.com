Huh, they must actually read what I said in their suggestion box.  :)

It's free to charge and park for the first 20 minutes, but after that it gets quite expensive because, hey, it's an airport.  I'd love to see these in the cell phone waiting lot too!  And really, they'd be able to add a lot more charging cheaply in long term parking using standard 120V outlets given that anyone parking in long term is going to leave their vehicle there for a long time.  Let's hope these become popular enough that they need to add more!

(I've seen a lot more Chevy Volts and Prius Primes around Iowa City lately.  It's happening!)
