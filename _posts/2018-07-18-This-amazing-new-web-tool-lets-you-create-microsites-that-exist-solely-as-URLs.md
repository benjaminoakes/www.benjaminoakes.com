> Former Google designer Nicholas Jitkoff, whos now the vice president of design at Dropbox, has created a [really nifty new web tool](http://about.bitty.site/) hes calling itty bitty sites, or self-contained microsites that exist solely as URLs. You can create your own by following this URL: [itty.bitty.site](https://itty.bitty.site/). From there, you can fill the equivalent of about one printed 8.5 x 11-inch page with any combination of plain text, ASCII characters, or emojis. The actual byte limit depends on where youd like to share it; Twitter and Slack allow for around 4,000 bytes, while the Mac version of Chrome can accommodate up to 10,000 bytes.

Very interesting.  Also, impossible to update since the code is frozen in the URL, but maybe that's okay sometimes.
