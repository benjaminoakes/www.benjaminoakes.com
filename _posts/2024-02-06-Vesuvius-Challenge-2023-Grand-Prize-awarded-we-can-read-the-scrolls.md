> The results of this review were clear and unanimous: the Vesuvius
Challenge Grand Prize of $700,000 is awarded to a team of three for their
excellent submission. In 2024 our goal is to go from 5% of one scroll, to
90% of all four scrolls we have scanned, and to lay the foundation to read
all 800 scrolls. The primary goal for 2024 is to read 90% of the scrolls,
and we will issue the 2024 Grand Prize to the first team that is able to do
this.

This is amazing work.  I've done some image analysis a little like this
(quite some time ago) and this is certainly impressive.  Congratulations to
the team!
