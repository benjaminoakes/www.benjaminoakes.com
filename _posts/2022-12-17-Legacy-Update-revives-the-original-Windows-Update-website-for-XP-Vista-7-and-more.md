>Since Windows XP was discontinued in 2014, followed by Windows 7 in 2020, Microsoft's support for their earlier OSes has significantly dwindled. As XP and earlier don't officially support modern security improvements, such as the SHA256 hash algorithm required by modern SSL and Authenticode certificates as of 2019, much of the internet has become inaccessible to these devices. Adding insult to injury, Microsoft actively removed many downloads for XP and earlier versions in 2020. In effect, working with these OSes is now incredibly difficult.

Very useful for preservation, though you should've be using these computers on the Internet any more.
