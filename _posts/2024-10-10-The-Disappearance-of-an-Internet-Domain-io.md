Generated summary:

> The article "The Disappearance of an Internet Domain" by Gareth Edwards explores the digital consequences of the UK transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This geopolitical shift will likely lead to the termination of the popular .io domain, which is linked to the British Indian Ocean Territory. While .io has become a favored domain for tech and gaming industries, its country code status ties it to real-world political changes. Drawing on historical precedents like the fall of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Yugoslavia, Edwards highlights how political upheavals can disrupt the digital landscape, particularly through changes in domain regulations. These shifts can lead to the forced expiration of domains like .io, affecting companies and users dependent on them. The article serves as a cautionary tale for tech founders, urging them to consider the political and physical implications of their digital infrastructure.

This is not good news for anyone with a .io domain.
