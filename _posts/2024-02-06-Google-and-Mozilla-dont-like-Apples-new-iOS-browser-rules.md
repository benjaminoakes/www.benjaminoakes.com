> Apple is being forced to make major changes to iOS in Europe, thanks to
the European Union's "Digital Markets Act." The act cracks down on Big Tech
"Gatekeepers" with various interoperability, fairness, and privacy demands,
and part of the changes demanded of Apple is to allow competing browser
engines on iOS. The change, due in iOS 17.4, will mean rival browsers like
Chrome and Firefox get to finally bring their own web rendering code to
iPhones and iPads. "The effect of this would be to force an independent
browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser
implementations-a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear." DeMonte
added: "Apple's proposals fail to give consumers viable choices by making
it as painful as possible for others to provide competitive alternatives to
Safari. This is another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true
browser competition on iOS.". For the rest of the world, even they don't
get a real browser choice; competing in the EU browser wars should make the
only iOS browser better for everyone.

We need competition.  And that means avoiding a Chromium monoculture too.
