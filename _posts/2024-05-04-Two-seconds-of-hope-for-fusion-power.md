> A breakthrough experiment done at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility in
San Diego may finally push nuclear fusion power plants to be roughly 29
years away. Tokamaks, compared to other fusion reactor designs like
stellarators, are the furthest along in their development; ITER, the
world's first power-plant-size fusion device now under construction in
France, is scheduled to run its first tests with plasma in December 2025.
"The major phenomenon people discovered in the high-density experiments was
reduced energy confinement when plasma density was increased," said Siye
Ding, a researcher at General Atomics working at the DIII-D National Fusion
Facility.
