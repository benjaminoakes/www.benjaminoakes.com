> You can access data from deleted forks, deleted repositories and even
private repositories on GitHub. In the video below, you'll see us fork a
repository, commit data to it, delete the fork, and then access the
"Deleted" commit data via the original repository. The average user views
the separation of private and public repositories as a security boundary,
and understandably believes that any data located in a private repository
cannot be accessed by public users.
