> I recently discovered a secret browser located inside the "Manage my
account" popup that Android has in various apps. Pros: It's a pretty
private browser : it has no history and it auto logs out of all Google
accounts that were logged-in, at the end of the session.

It also avoids parental controls. This is problematic, especially now that
it's widely shared.
