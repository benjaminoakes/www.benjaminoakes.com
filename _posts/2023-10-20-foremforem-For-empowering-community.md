>Forem is open source software for building communities. Communities for your peers, customers, fanbases, families, friends, and any other time and space where people need to come together to be part of a collective. See our announcement post for a high-level overview of what Forem is.  [...]  [dev.to](https://dev.to) (or just DEV) is hosted by Forem. It is a community of software developers who write articles, take part in discussions, and build their professional profiles.
