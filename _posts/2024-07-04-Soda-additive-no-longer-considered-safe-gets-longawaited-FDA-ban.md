title: "Soda additive \"no longer considered safe,\" gets long-awaited FDA ban"
date: 2024-07-04

> By the early 1960s, the FDA had put BVO on its first inventory of food
additives it deemed generally safe-designated "Generally recognized as
safe" or GRAS. But safety concerns quickly surfaced, and by the late 1960s,
the FDA had already limited its use to a flavoring stabilizer and capped
the amount that could be used to 15 parts per million. The FDA reports that
only a few beverages in the US still use the additive. Consumer advocates
chided the FDA while celebrating the ban.
