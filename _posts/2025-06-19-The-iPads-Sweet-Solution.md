>In the end, all of this begs a question: as much as I love my iPad, if Im mostly relying on web apps and cross-platform services when using it, and if Apple is going to offer a phone that unfolds into a small tablet by 2026why am I not using a Mac at this point? Is the iPad still a good investment for productivity, or has it turned into a liability for the vast majority of non-artistic, professional users?

The iPad definitely occupies an awkward space. Good for content consumption, but too big to always have on you, like a phone.  Good for creating, but not enough to completely replace a laptop.  I have a ThinkPad Yoga for this reason.  It runs Ubuntu well. That's great for someone like me.

Every device has a place. And I'm happy web apps can run on both devices I've described.
