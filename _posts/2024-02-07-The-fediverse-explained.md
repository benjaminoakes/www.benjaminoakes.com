>At some point over the last year, you've probably come across the term
"fediverse" a few times. Maybe you've read about it here at The Verge or
seen some internet oldhead talking on their blog about how this is the
internet they were hoping for back in 1993. Maybe someone sent you that
"Protocols, Not Platforms" article so you'd think they were smart.
