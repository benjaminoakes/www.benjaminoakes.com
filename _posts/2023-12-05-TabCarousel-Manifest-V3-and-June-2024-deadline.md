Regarding TabCarousel, a Chrome extension I created:

>This extension may stop working on or after June 1st, 2024 due to a change in policy that will disallow Manifest v2 in favor of v3.  This is more than a simple technical change.  If you are curious to know more, please search out more information.
>
> As a result, I am personally switching to [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com).  I also don't use TabCarousel very often anymore.  I [built a Firefox-compatible alpha](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/TabCarousel/pull/37) in 2017 as a proof-of-concept.  Pull requests for improvements are welcome.
>
> I would also accept pull requests to implement Manifest v3 for Chrome, but it's not something that I have the time, energy, or desire to implement myself.  That said, if any users are interested in helping fund this work, please reach out.
