> The Observer pattern (also known as publish/subscribe) provides a simple mechanism for one object to inform a set of interested third-party objects when its state changes.

Source: [Module: Observable (Ruby 3.1.2)](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.1.2/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html#method-i-notify_observers)

I always forget that Ruby has a built-in `Oberserver` implementation.
