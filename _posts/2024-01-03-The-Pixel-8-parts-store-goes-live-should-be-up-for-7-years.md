 > The Pixel 8 is the first Google phone with seven years of major OS 
updates, and Google previously said these parts will be in stock for 
seven years to match, so the phone sounds like it will be a longevity

It's great that competitors like the Fairphone are making larger 
companies care about this. However, the replacement costs are likely to 
be high enough (e.g. $200 for just the camera module) to make repairs 
unlikely.
