>Instead of relying on the lack of right to repair laws, Apple is simply making it so that using any parts not approved by Apple in a repair would make your Apple device not function properly. They do so by VIN-locking, or parts-pairing as it's called in the tech industry, parts, and if the device's SoC detects that an unapproved repair is taking place, the device simply won't accept it, even if genuine Apple parts are being used. Trying to circumvent this parts-pairing violates the DMCA -- and the DMCA is federal law, while California's right to repair bill it state law, meaning the DMCA overrules it.
