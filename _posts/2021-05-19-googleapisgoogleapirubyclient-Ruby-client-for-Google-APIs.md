> This repository contains a set of simple client libraries for various Google APIs. These libraries are generated automatically from [Discovery Documents](https://developers.google.com/discovery), and the code generator is also hosted here in this repository.
> 
> Each client provides:
> 
> * A client object that connects to the HTTP/JSON REST endpoint for the service.
> * Ruby objects for data structures related to the service.
> * Integration with the googleauth gem for authentication using OAuth, API keys, and service accounts.
> * Control of retry, pagination, and timeouts.
> 
> These client libraries are officially supported by Google, and are updated regularly to track changes to the service. [...]
