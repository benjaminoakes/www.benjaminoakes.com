> One of those projects was TenFourFox, a fork of the Firefox browser for G3, G4, and G5-based PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5. Maintained primarily by Cameron Kaiser, the TenFourFox project sprang up in late 2010 after Mozilla pulled PowerPC support from Firefox 4 during its development. And amazingly, the browser has continued to trundle on ever since.

I used TenFourFox on a few old Macs before I gave them away.  They were pretty slow by modern standards (even though they originally cost thousands of dollars), but it was nice to have an option to go on the web.  It's amazing that such a quality browser was maintained by a single person.  I know that tech isn't the maintainer's day job, but I saw in the comments that they may actually be an MD.  It's hard to comprehend being able to do both medicine and tech well, as there Is some impressive work that's gone into TenFourFox.  The time commitment must be pretty large.  (Perhaps Cameron doesn't have kids?)

Reading through the comments revealed some other interesting projects, such as:

- [tenox7/wrp: Web Rendering Proxy: Use vintage, historical, legacy browsers on modern web](https://github.com/tenox7/wrp)
- [Web Browsing with Legacy Proxy - The metalbabble.com 68k blog](https://metalbabble.wordpress.com/2020/12/06/better-web-browsing-with-legacy-proxy/)

I'm surprised that WRP exists.  It seems like it's probably a toy project, but I would be very interested in knowing whether anyone uses something like this frequently.  It's cool to keep older tech in use, but I have to admit, it's an increasingly uphill battle.
