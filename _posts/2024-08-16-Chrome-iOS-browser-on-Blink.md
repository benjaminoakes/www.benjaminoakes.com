> I don't use iOS, nor do I intend to any time soon, but the coming
availability of browser engines that compete with WebKit is going to be
great for the web. I've heard from so many web developers that Safari on
iOS is a bit of a nightmare to support, since without any competition on
iOS it often stagnates and lags behind in supporting features other
browsers already implemented. With WebKit on iOS facing competition, that
might change.

This should be available everywhere.
