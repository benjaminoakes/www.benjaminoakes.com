Two articles on complexity both hit 500 points on Hacker News recently. They both have similar stack complexity" graphs.

- [Just Use Postgres for Everything | Amazing CTO](https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/)
- [We're breaking up with JavaScript frontends](http://triskweline.de/unpoly-rugb/#/)

That last one is good. It's by the folks at Makandra, whom I have a great deal of respect for. They make ActiveType and also Unpoly (the subject of their presentation). It's similar to Hotwire and HTMX.
