This is really interesting.  It can't be used with Rails (yet), but it seems like it's just a matter of time before that's possible.  Async seems to provide something similar to JavaScript-esque `async` and `await`, but without new language keywords.  I've hoped something like this would be made, and I'm happy to have learned about it.

I haven't tried it out yet, but I'm looking forward to it.

Here are some additional resources I'm looking at:

- GitHub: [socketry/async: An awesome asynchronous event-driven reactor for Ruby.](https://github.com/socketry/async)
- Documentation [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/async/guides/getting-started/index.html)

**Edit:** I just understood the Async logo.  It's a sink.  Asink.  Clever.
