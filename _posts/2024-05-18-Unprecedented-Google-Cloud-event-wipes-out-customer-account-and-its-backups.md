title: "\"Unprecedented\" Google Cloud event wipes out customer account and its backups"

> UniSuper, an Australian pension fund that manages $135 billion worth of
funds and has 647,000 members, had its entire account wiped out at Google
Cloud, including all its backups that were stored on the service. Google
Cloud is supposed to have safeguards that don't allow account deletion, but
none of them worked apparently, and the only option was a restore from a
separate cloud provider. A June 2023 press release touted UniSuper's big
cloud migration to Google, with Sam Cooper, UniSuper's Head of
Architecture, saying, "With Google Cloud VMware Engine, migrating to the
cloud is streamlined and extremely easy. It's all about efficiencies that
help us deliver highly competitive fees for our members."
