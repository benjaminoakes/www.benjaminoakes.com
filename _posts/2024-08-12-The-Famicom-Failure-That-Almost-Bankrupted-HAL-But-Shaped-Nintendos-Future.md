> The very magnitude of its failure helps to explain the close relationship
that exists between Nintendo and HAL today, with the latter producing games
like the first two Super Smash Bros. Iwata, who became president of HAL in
1993 and then president of Nintendo in 2002, worked as a producer on the
game, which took four years to finish in a time when game development was
often measured in months, not years. Iwata himself avoided talking about
the exact circumstances of the deal: "I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to go
into the details but many people at Nintendo had faith in us: 'if they can
just unleash their true potential, they'll be a great developer.' People
like Miyamoto, who had known firsthand about our contribution to Nintendo
since the early Famicom days, were saying stuff like that, and so were
several other key people at Nintendo. In the past we had applied ourselves
and made solid, quality games that were profitable."
