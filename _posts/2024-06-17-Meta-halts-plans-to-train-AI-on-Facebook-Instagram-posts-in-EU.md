> Meta was going to start training AI on Facebook and Instagram posts on
June 26.
>
> "The DPC welcomes the decision by Meta to pause its plans to train its
large language model using public content shared by adults on Facebook and
Instagram across the EU/EEA," the DPC said. The European Center for Digital
Rights, known as Noyb, had filed 11 complaints across the EU and intended
to file more to stop Meta from moving forward with its AI plans. In a blog,
Meta had previously teased new AI features coming to the EU, including
everything from customized stickers for chats and stories to Meta AI, a
"Virtual assistant you can access to answer questions, generate images, and
more." Meta had argued that training on EU users' personal data was
necessary so that AI services could reflect "The diverse cultures and
languages of the European communities who will use them."
