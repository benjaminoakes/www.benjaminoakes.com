title: "Study finds no \"smoking gun\" for mental health issues due to Internet usage"

> A study of more than 2 million people's Internet use found no "Smoking
gun" for widespread harm to mental health from online activities such as
browsing social media and gaming, despite widely claimed concerns that
mobile apps can cause depression and anxiety. In their paper, Przybylski
and Vuorre studied data on psychological wellbeing from 2.4 million people
aged 15 to 89 in 168 countries between 2005 and 2022, which they contrasted
with industry data about growth in Internet subscriptions over that time,
as well as tracking associations between mental health and Internet
adoption in 202 countries from 2000-19. "Our results do not provide
evidence supporting the view that the Internet and technologies enabled by
it, such as smartphones with Internet access, are actively promoting or
harming either wellbeing or mental health globally," they concluded.

I suspect the answer is nuanced and that this deserves more research.
