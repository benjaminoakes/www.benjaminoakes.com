[Google Recorder](https://recorder.google.com/) is a really nice feature on newer Android phones and an accompanying web app.  It records audio as well as provides an automated transcription.

There is a share button on the web app, but it only gives two options: private and "anyone with the link can view."  That's unfortunate because many users would expect to be able to share with an individual with a Google Account.

Fortunately, there's also a download button.  You can download the audio and transcript and upload them to a folder in Google Drive for sharing.  Unfortunately, the timestamps in the transcript are lost, so it's best to keep the recording in the Recorder app as well.
