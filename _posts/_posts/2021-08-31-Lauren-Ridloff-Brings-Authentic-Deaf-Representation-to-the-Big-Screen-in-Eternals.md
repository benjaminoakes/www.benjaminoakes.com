It turns out her character isn't deaf or a woman in the comics.  They changed the character to match the actor.  She will now be Marvel's first deaf superhero.

I'm extremely interested to see how ASL is integrated into this movie.  Do the other characters know ASL?  Does that factor into the plot at all?

(By the way, I wish mainstream media wouldn't cut away from or change angles on signing during interviews.  I can only imagine how I would feel about this if ASL was my first language.)
