> In September 2006, the mayor of Sao Paulo passed the so-called Clean
City Law" that outlawed the use of all outdoor advertisements, including on
billboards, transit, and in front of stores. Within a year, 15,000
billboards were taken down and store signs had to be shrunk so as not to
violate the new law. Outdoor video screens and ads on buses were stripped.
Even pamphleteering in public spaces has been made illegal. Nearly $8
million in fines were issued to cleanse Sao Paulo of the blight on its
landscape. Seven years on, the world's fourth-largest metropolis and South
America's most important city remains free of visual clutter and eye sore
that plagues the majority of cities around the world.
