title: "How OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Was Fired by Rival Board Members"

> OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was ousted in a sudden boardroom knifing on Friday,
arising from a power struggle over the direction of the company behind
ChatGPT. According to a tweet from former OpenAI President Greg Brockman,
Altman received a text on Thursday night from OpenAI chief scientist and
fellow board member Ilya Sutskever, asking him to meet at noon on Friday. A
knowledgeable source said the board struggle reflected a cultural clash at
the organization, with Altman and Brockman focused on commercialization and
Sutskever and his allies focused on the original non-profit mission of
OpenAI. The board oversees the nonprofit that controls the organization's
for-profit subsidiary with a stated mission to create safe artificial
general intelligence that is broadly beneficial to humanity. A number of
board members left OpenAI this year prior to Altman's departure, including
former congressman Will Hurd, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and
Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, who is the mother of two of Elon Musk's
children.
