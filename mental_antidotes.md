# Mental Antidotes

These antidotes address undesirable mental states and should be used when that state is noticed.

Heavily inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh and Buddhism in general

(This document is a draft)

## Definitions

These energies can be applied to many situations:

- Compassion: Send loving-kindness to another person or group.  "May they be happy, may they be healthy, may they be safe, may their lives go with ease."  This will often include attempting to understand other people's perspectives.
- Mindfulness:  Remember you're alive and in the here and now.  Come back home to the present moment.  Notice it.  Touch reality.
  - Use deep breathing with longer out-breaths than in-breaths.  This stimulates the brain to calm down.  Focus on breathing at the level of the belly (as opposed to the nose, for example).
  - See 5-4-3-2-1 under "Anxiety"
- Thought: analytictal reasoning.  Best left compartmentalized to a particular time.
  - It can be helpful to have a collection habit, as described in David Allen's _Getting Things Done_ so there's a time and a place.
  - A journaling habit is useful as well to give a time to analyze.  Journaling should also highlight at least 3 positive aspects of life from the last 24 hours.

## Thought Loop

One can reach a general state of contentment if the following steps are followed consistently:

- Notice the emotion
- Identify what emotion or mix of emotions is present
- Accept it and embrace it.  Greet it ("Hello Anxiety")
- Thank the emotion for the opportunity to practice these skills
- Forgive yourself for what caused this emotion to arise.  (Don't beat yourself up)
- In most cases: identify why.  Listen to any coincidental thoughts for clues if it's not clear.
   - In some cases, depression can be misserved by identifying the reason.  Focus on improving the mental state.

Also, make a point to generate happiness.

## Emotions

There are 5 basic emotions:

- Happiness (see above to generate)
- Sadness
- Anger
- Fear
- Disgust

Each can be further subdivided.

### Happiness

How to generate:

- Make an effort to notice good things.  Think good thoughts and more good thoughts will follow.  This is key for avoiding depressive states.  Journal the good things that have been noticed.
- Do less.  [Stop Running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qch5ISD9Bxo) from thing to thing.
- Generally practice [the Eightfold Path](https://tricycle.org/beginners/buddhism/eightfold-path)
  - Right view 
  - Right intention 
  - Right speech 
  - Right action
  - Right livelihood
  - Right effort

### Fear: Anxiety

How to notice:

- Tingling sensation
- Increased heart rate

How to address:

- Mindfulness is especially helpful.  Try doing 5-4-3-2-1: Focus on 5 thing you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
- Let anxious thoughts pass by.  It's important to recognize them and then send them on their way.  Avoid analysis of axious thoughts because giving them thought energy increases anxiety.

- Imagine ways to change the environment that brought about depression
- Longer term: actually change the environment in some of the imagined ways
