# Mental Antidotes

These antidotes address undesirable mental states and should be used when that state is noticed.

Heavily inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh

## Definitions

These energies can be applied to many situations:

- Compassion: Send loving-kindness to another person or group.  "May they be happy, may they be healthy, may they be safe, may their lives go with ease."  This will often include attempting to understand other people's perspective.
- Mindfulness:  Remember you're alive and in the here and now.  Come back home to the present moment.  Notice it.  Touch reality.
  - Use deep breathing with longer out-breaths than in-breaths.  This stimulates the brain to calm down.  Focus on breathing at the level of the belly (as opposed to the nose, for example).

## Thought Loop

- Notice the emotion
- Identify what emotion or mix of emotions is present
- Accept it and embrace it.  Greet it ("Hello Anxiety")
- Thank the emotion for the opportunity to practice these skills
- In most cases: identify why.  Listen to any coincidental thoughts for clues if it's not clear.
   - In some cases, depression can be misserved by identifying the reason.  Focus on improving the mental state.

## Emotions

### Anger

How to notice:

- Hard to control speech and actions
- Faster breathing, pulse

How to address:

- Compassion toward the object of anger.  Attempt to understand their perspective.

### Fear

How to notice:

- "Hollowed out" feeling in the stomach

How to address:

- Mindfulness
- Send yourself compassion
- Send others compassion, especially those causing fear.  Attempt to understand their perspective.
- Remember that you have non-fear inside you (non-fear: "steadfastness" and some definitions of courage)

### Anxiety

How to notice:

- Tingling sensation

How to address:

- See "Fear"
- Also intermingled with "Depression"

### Depression

How to notice:

- Love seeking (e.g. lots of hugs)
- Lethargic (don't want to do anything)
- Sensations are a bit "muted" compared to normal
- Inability to sleep

How to address:

- Mindfulness
- Intentional focus on relaxation
- Think good thoughts.  IMPORTANT: This is easily forgotten in a depressed state.  Start with at least 3 happy/grateful things from the last 24 hours.  Whenever possible, write them down.
- Imagine ways to change the environment that brought about depression
- Longer term: actually change the environment in some of the imagined ways
