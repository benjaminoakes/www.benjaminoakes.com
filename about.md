Hi, I'm Ben Oakes and this is my geek blog.

![Proudly Creating Software in Iowa's Creative Corridor](/images/wch_software-01.png)

Currently, I'm a Ruby/JavaScript Developer working remotely from Iowa City, IA.  I also organize [TechCorridor.io](http://techcorridor.io/), especially the [Ruby meetup](http://www.icruby.org/).  I previously organized [NewHaven.rb](http://www.newhavenrb.org/) which morphed into [NewHaven.io](http://www.newhaven.io).

I also consider myself a sustainability enthusiast.  If you'd like to talk about solar power, electric vehicles, waste reduction (including recycling), vegetarianism, or vegetable gardening, please [get in touch](../contact)!
